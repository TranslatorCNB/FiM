'''CHS Rally Song'''是《[[小马国女孩：彩虹摇滚]]》六首歌中的第二首。在电影中，[[人类云宝]]与[[坎特拉高中]]的其他学生一起演奏了此歌以振奋大家的情绪，以迎接即将到来的[[友谊大赛（活动）|友谊大赛]]。本曲首次出现于2015年8月29日播出的《友谊大赛》先睹为快视频中。此外，本曲还是原声专辑《[[My Little Pony Equestria Girls: Friendship Games - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]》上的第六首歌。

==制作与重复使用==
本曲还出现在了在小说版本的《友谊大赛》的第四章中，但歌词与电影版本不同。

本曲的部分歌词被用于《Equestria Girls (Cafeteria Song)》的“友谊大赛”版本中，本曲的旋律还被用在了孩之宝的小马国女孩线上游戏[http://equestriagirls.hasbro.com/en-us/media/archery-game:74400C8B-5056-9047-F5C6-E9964E61DD54 Archery Game]里。

:'''云宝黛茜''': Crystal Prep students are super athletic, super smart, and super motivated. But there's one thing they ''aren't''. They aren't Wondercolts!

::We've fought magic more than once
::And come out on top

:'''[合唱队]'''
::Oh, oh

:'''[云宝黛茜]'''
::There's other schools, but none can make those claims

:'''[合唱队]'''
::Na, na-na-na-na, oh
