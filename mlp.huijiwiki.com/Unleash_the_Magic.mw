:'''[Principal Cinch]'''
::I realize that you've always been an outcast
::It's not everyone at school who likes to think
::To find a student that's like you
::I've had one or maybe two
::But the good ones disappear before I blink

:'''[Shadowbolts]'''
::(Oh, wuh-oh-wuh, oh
::Oh, wuh-oh-wuh)

:'''[Principal Cinch]'''
::Now, I understand you have your reservations (oh-wuh)
::It's hard to have a brain as large as yours (oh-oh-oh-oh)
::But if we don't win these games
::Well, I think I've made it plain
::What will happen if we have the losing scores!

:'''[Shadowbolts]'''
::(Oh, wuh-oh-wuh, oh
::Oh, wuh-oh-wuh)

::Unleash the magic, unleash the magic
::If we lose, then you're to blame (ah, ah-ah-ah)
::They all have used it, maybe abused it (ah-ah-ah)
::So then why can't we do the same?

::(Oh, wuh-oh-wuh, oh
::Oh, wuh-oh-wuh)

:'''[Principal Cinch]'''
::Call it power, call it magic
::If we lose, it will be tragic
::More important is the knowledge we'll have lost (oh-oh-oh-oh)
::A chance like this won't come again
::You'll regret not giving in
::Isn't understanding magic worth the cost?

:'''[Shadowbolts]'''
::(Oh, wuh-oh-wuh, oh
::Oh, wuh-oh-wuh)

::Unleash the magic, unleash the magic
::We're not friends here after all
::Our only interest in this business (ah-ah-ah)
::Is seeing Canterlot High School fall

::(Oh, wuh-oh-wuh, oh
::Oh, wuh-oh-wuh, oh)

:'''[Principal Cinch]'''
::What I'm suggesting's very simple
::And since it's win-win on all scores
::You only want to learn about the
::Magic that you have stored

::And as for me and all the others
::We only want what we deserve
::That our school will clinch the win
::And my...

:'''[Principal Cinch and Shadowbolts]'''
::...legacy will endure

::Unleash the magic, unleash the magic
::If we lose, then it's a crime
::But we can win it if you begin it (ah-ah-ah)
::It's up to you to not fail this time

:'''[Male Shadowbolts]'''
::Unleash the magic, free the magic now

:'''[Female Shadowbolts]'''
::Unleash the magic, free the magic now

{| style="width:100%;"
|
:'''[Sci-Twi]'''
::Imagine all I'll learn by setting it free

:'''Vice Principal Luna''': If both teams are ready...

:'''[Male Shadowbolts]'''
::Unleash the magic, free the magic now

:'''[Female Shadowbolts]'''

:'''[Sci-Twi]'''
::And now winning these games depends on me
|
:'''[Male Shadowbolts]'''
::Unleash the magic, free the magic now

:'''[Female Shadowbolts]'''
::Unleash the magic, free the magic now
|-

::And what doors might open if I try to use it

:'''Dean Cadance''': ...the last event of the Friendship Games begins...

:'''[Male Shadowbolts]'''
::Unleash the magic, free the magic now

:'''[Female Shadowbolts]'''
::Unleash the magic, free the magic now

:'''[Shadowbolts]'''
::Unleash the magic, free the magic...
::Unleash the magic, free the magic...
