<section begin="song" />
:'''[Applejack]'''
::You'll never believe!
::This Hearth's Warming Eve
::An unwanted guest
::Became such a pest

::But all on my own
::I'll do it alone
::The traps are all set
::I won't give up yet!

::The plans are in place
::Let's end this rat race!
::But something feels wrong
::It's taking too long!

::But how could this be?!
::He's outsmarted me!
::The scarecrows have failed
::And the squash has bailed!

::I feel like a fool
::It's getting too cruel!
::That paint should have worked
::I'm getting quite irked!

::Oh it's such a pain!
::Is it all in vain?
::That Squash has me beat
::I can't take defeat!<section end="song"></section>
