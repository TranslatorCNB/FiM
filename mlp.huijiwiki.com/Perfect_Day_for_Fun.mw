在广播音乐公司的网站上本曲名为《With My Best Friends》。

==制作==
The short was adapted into chapter 1 of the ''Rainbow Rocks'' novelization, which was released months earlier than the short itself. According to the book, as is for the short [[Shake Your Tail]], Twilight and Spike's presence in this short is just a figment of Twilight's imagination, because she misses her Canterlot High friends, so she imagines to be there with them.

==动画短片剧情简介==
The short is a music video wherein [[Twilight Sparkle]] and her human friends have fun at a [[Canterlot High]] evening carnival. With the exception of Applejack, the six have no dialogue in the short and instead communicate via text messages. Interspersed with this are shots of the girls singing and playing instruments on a stage.

[[Applejack (EG)|Applejack]] and [[Rainbow Dash (EG)|Rainbow Dash]] try a high-striker game; both of them are beaten by puppy [[Spike]]. [[Fluttershy (EG)|Fluttershy]] plays "Whack-A-Mole!", but instead of whacking the moles, she pets them. She does however whack a [[Discord]] plush doll out of Twilight's hands. [[Pinkie Pie (EG)|Pinkie Pie]] and [[Rarity (EG)|Rarity]] enjoy cotton candy. Eventually the six friends meet up at a pair of photo booths and take pictures.

As the girls begin their stage performance, everyone on the carnival grounds starts dancing. Photos on Twilight's phone show the six friends enjoying other carnival games and attractions. At the end of the song, Spike, [[Flash Sentry (EG)|Flash Sentry]], the [[Cutie Mark Crusaders (EG)|Cutie Mark Crusaders]], [[Big McIntosh]], [[Cheerilee (EG)|Miss Cheerilee]], [[Granny Smith]], [[Trixie (EG)|Trixie Lulamoon]], [[DJ Pon-3 (EG)|DJ Pon-3]], and [[Vice Principal Luna]] come together for a group photo. The short concludes with Twilight and her friends looking at photos while riding the Ferris wheel.
