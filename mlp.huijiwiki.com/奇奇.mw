奇奇的身体和鬃毛的颜色与[[劳伦·浮士德]]关于萍琪派的概念图一致，都是基于一只同样名为“Surprise”的G1天马[[File:Lauren Faust Surprise.jpg|thumb|劳伦·浮士德关于萍琪的概念图]] Surprise has the same coat and mane colors as [[Lauren Faust]]'s concept art of [[Pinkie Pie]], based on a G1 Pegasus mare also named [[mlw:Surprise|Surprise]]; as the Pegasus mare [[mlw:G4 Breezie|Breezie]] from the fifth wave of [[Toys#Mystery packs|mystery pack toys]] and [[Merchandise#Collector cards|collector cards]]; and as [[List of comic ponies#Heather Nuhfer|the Heather Nuhfer Pegasus mare]] from the IDW comics' {{comic|8|''Friendship is Magic'' Issue #8}}. Surprise usually has the same mane and tail style as [[Blaze]] and "[[List of ponies/Pegasus ponies#Nightingale|Nightingale]]", but when [[#IDW comics|shown]] without her uniform on, instead has Pinkie's mane and tail style as in Faust's concept art.

Surprise, along with [[Soarin]] and as well as "[[Dainty Dove]]"、[[Lady Justice]], and [[Tall Order]], was to appear in [[Friendship is Magic, part 1]].<ref>AssetsLicensor.zip.

==剧中描述==
[[File:The Wonderbolts in shock S01E03.png|thumb|Surprise slack-jawed in [[The Ticket Master]].]] Surprise first appears in [[Rainbow Dash]]'s imagination in [[The Ticket Master]] alongside [[Soarin]] and [[Blaze]]. Rainbow imagines herself impressing the [[Wonderbolts]] so much that they let her join them. She later appears in [[The Best Night Ever]], once again in Rainbow Dash's fantasy of flying with the Wonderbolts as well as in the Wonderbolts' V.I.P. section at the [[Grand Galloping Gala]].

Surprise, with her mane a darker shade of yellow, appears as one of the [[Pegasi]] fighting against a monstrous [[Spike]] in [[Secret of My Excess]], alongside Blaze and [[High Winds]]. Spike traps her and her fellow Wonderbolts inside a water tower. Near the end of the episode, when they're finally freed, Surprise trembles with fear before striking a heroic pose and flying off with Blaze and High Winds.

Surprise later appears with her usual mane color in [[Rainbow Falls]], watching the [[Cloudsdale]] cheerleaders.

Surprise makes a background appearance in [[Rarity Investigates!]] In [[Newbie Dash]], Surprise's eyes are revealed to be raspberry, and she has a speaking role in which she reveals her Wonderbolts nickname as "Slowpoke".
