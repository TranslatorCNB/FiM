==概要==
===Post-cutie mark meeting===
[[File:Apple Bloom sees that her friends are staring at their cutie marks S6E4.png|thumb|"Is this all we're gonna do now?"]] 在[[Cutie Mark Crusaders]]的俱乐部小屋，[[Apple Bloom]]召开了自从她们[[Crusaders of the Lost Mark|获得]]她们的[[可爱标志]]后的第一次会议。不幸的是，[[Sweetie Belle]]和[[Scootaloo]]太过迷恋自己的可爱标志以至于精力不集中。Apple Bloom忘记了自己已经获得可爱标志，还建议出去尝试新事情，例如广场舞和攀登。

然而，Sweetie Belle和Scootaloo把她拉回了现实，Apple Bloom很尴尬，才想起她们已经得到了可爱标记。The three fillies realize that crusading for their marks is all they have ever done, and they wonder what to do next. Apple Bloom suggests they do what their cutie marks symbolize: helping other ponies find out or rediscover what makes them special.

===Finding ponies to help===
The Crusaders travel around [[Ponyville]] to find ponies with cutie mark-related problems—from [[Big McIntosh]] to [[Pound Cake and Pumpkin Cake]] to [[Mayor Mare]]—but all of the ponies they meet appear to be perfectly content with their special talents and lives. As the Crusaders start to question how special they truly are, they encounter [[Bulk Biceps]], who says he has a cutie mark problem.

[[File:Apple Bloom says yeah S6E4.png|thumb|left|The Crusaders' first "client".]] The Crusaders invite Bulk back to their clubhouse—despite the cramped space—and he explains that his cutie mark is a dumbbell, but he has lifted every dumbbell in Ponyville. When they suggest he find other things to lift, he asks what to do after that. They then suggest that he teach other ponies to lift things, and this quickly satisfies him.

Apple Bloom worries that there aren't many ponies in Ponyville with cutie mark problems and those that do have problems are too easily solved. Because of this, she wonders if the Cutie Mark Crusaders have any reason to exist.

===[[Out On My Own]]===
[[File:Sweetie Belle and Apple Bloom's ears irritated S6E4.png|thumb|Scootaloo still can't carry a tune.]] The Crusaders take stock of their situation—too few ponies to help and easily solvable cutie mark problems—and Apple Bloom proposes expanding their search to all of [[Equestria]]. Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo believe that's too much for them to handle and they should instead focus on helping ponies in Ponyville. Until then, they can just do things for fun without the pressure of getting their cutie marks.

The three fillies try out several activities around town, such as scootering and singing, but they find it difficult to think of something they are all interested in. Despite Apple Bloom's reservations, the three decide to pursue separate interests. Suddenly on her own, Apple Bloom tries to find something fun to do, all while singing a heartfelt ballad. Unfortunately, she can't, particularly because she doesn't have Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo to do it with.

[[File:Apple Bloom and dancing colt tango S6E4.png|thumb|left|Apple Bloom takes up dancing.]] For a brief time, Apple Bloom discovers an interest in dancing in a class taught by [[List of ponies#Hoofer Steps|Hoofer Steps]], and she substitutes for a shy student named [[Tender Taps]]. Due to her lack of dancing talent, however, she struggles to fit in. As Apple Bloom leaves, she talks with Tender Taps, who has a lot of tap-dancing talent but suffers from stage fright.

{{Quote|I bet some day my cutie mark will even be about performing! But I could never dance in front of an audience the way I do in class. That's t-t-t-t-terrifying!|Tender Taps}}

===You don't need to be good===
[[File:Apple Bloom's walls of failed interests S6E4.png|thumb|What good is fun if you have no one to share it with?]] Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo return to the Crusaders clubhouse after an afternoon of fun spent crocheting and bungee-jumping. Inside the clubhouse, they find Apple Bloom sitting alone in the dark. After trying dozens of activities and failing to find anything that interests her, Apple Bloom despairs about finding happiness now that she and her friends don't hang out anymore. Scootaloo corrects her by stating they can still hang out, but they don't have to do ''everything'' together.

Apple Bloom admits that she did like dancing, but she wasn't very good at it. Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo tell her she doesn't need to be good in order to have fun. When Apple Bloom mentions Tender Taps and his performance troubles, Sweetie Belle asks if he had his cutie mark.

[[File:Sweetie Belle "you'll be just fine!" S6E4.png|thumb|left|The Crusaders help Tender Taps.]] At the Ponyville dance theater, the Crusaders find Tender Taps backstage, and Apple Bloom tries to convince him to perform. When Tender Taps expresses fear from performing in front of an audience, Apple Bloom says she'll perform with him so he'll look good by comparison.

While Sweetie Belle provides them with costumes and Scootaloo assists with the stage backdrop, Apple Bloom and Tender Taps perform a tap-dancing act together. Apple Bloom mostly embarrasses herself, but Tender Taps manages to overcome his stage fright and impress the audience with his dancing. As the ponies cheer for him, he earns a tap-dancing cutie mark.

===尾声===
[[File:Apple Bloom "we'll be better!" S6E4.png|thumb|A new chapter in the Cutie Mark Crusaders' lives.]] Tender Taps thanks the Cutie Mark Crusaders for helping him realize his tap-dancing potential. He tells Apple Bloom that he hopes she continues dancing, and Apple Bloom says she will. Apple Bloom apologizes to her friends for being so silly about them trying new things on their own, and Sweetie Belle says by doing so, they'll be three times as likely to find ponies to help.

:'''Scootaloo''': Yeah, we need to go try new stuff like we used to!
:'''Apple Bloom''': Exactly.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Like square dancing!
:[square dancing music]
:'''Scootaloo''': Or mountain climbing! [stock yodel]
:'''Apple Bloom''': Or square dancin' on the mountain we just climbed!

:'''Sweetie Belle''': But are you sure you feel content?
:'''Big McIntosh''': Eeyup.
:'''Scootaloo''': Not even a ''tinge'' of dissatisfaction?
:'''Big McIntosh''': Nnnope.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Not even the ''slightest'' naggin' sensation that you don't really know what your purpose is in life or why you have a big apple as a cutie mark?
:[thump]
:'''Big McIntosh''': [grunts] [spits] [annoyed] Nnnope.

:'''Sweetie Belle''': [blows tone] Do... Mi... So... It's just a simple harmony.
:'''Scootaloo''': Harmony, huh?
:'''Sweetie Belle''': [tapping with stick] And a-one, and a-two, and a-one two three! [on-key] Do...
:'''Apple Bloom''': [simultaneously, off-key] So...!
:'''Scootaloo''': [simultaneously, ''very'' off-key] ''Mi!'' Wow, that ''was'' simple!

:[pen squeaking]
:'''Apple Bloom''': ...Sweetie Belle would rather ''keep'' bees.

:'''Apple Bloom''': I don't see how I'm supposed to be happy that we're not hanging out anymore!
:'''Scootaloo''': Wait, I never said that. I just said we don't have to do ''everything'' together.
:'''Sweetie Belle''': Like when there's something one of us wants to do that the others don't.
:'''Apple Bloom''': Oh. [beat] Well, I guess that changes things.

:'''Apple Bloom''': Well, one thing is for sure. The Cutie Mark Crusaders will never be the same. We'll be better!
