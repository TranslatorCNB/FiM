'''Equestria Girls''' is a [[Songs|song]] in ''[[My Little Pony Equestria Girls]]''. [[Twilight Sparkle]] and her new human friends sing the song in the [[Canterlot High School|Canterlot High]] school cafeteria in order to create unity between the students and boost Twilight's popularity, and to also help everyone forget about Twilight's embarrassing video. It is the only song in the movie performed onscreen by the characters.
