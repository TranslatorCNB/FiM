== 剧中叙述 ==
The Equestrian founders' story serves as the focus of the season two episode [[Hearth's Warming Eve]], reenacted through an annual [[Hearth's Warming|holiday]] stage pageant. Long ago, before the rule of [[Princess Celestia]], [[Earth ponies]], [[unicorns]], and [[Pegasi]] were divided by hatred and only cared about their own tribe. The tense peace between the pony tribes is eventually broken by a mysterious blizzard.

Princess Platinum of the unicorns, Commander Hurricane of the Pegasi, and Chancellor Puddinghead of the Earth ponies hold a summit to figure out how to cope with the blizzard, but they are unable to reach an agreement. After the three leaders confer with their subordinates—unicorn advisor Clover the Clever, Pegasus Private Pansy, and Earth pony secretary Smart Cookie—they decide to set out and find a new land.

The three pairs all meet in the same location and argue over whom has first stake over the new land, causing another blizzard to start. The six ponies take shelter in a cave, but as Puddinghead, Hurricane, and Platinum continue to argue, they are soon frozen in ice. Clover the Clever identifies the cause of the blizzard to be [[windigos]]—winter spirits that feed on hatred.

Despite the animosity between their leaders and tribes, Smart Cookie, Pansy, and Clover maintain warm relations, and they eventually break the windigos' spell through the [[Hearth's Warming Eve#The Fire of Friendship|Fire of Friendship]]. Their warmth thaws their leaders' bodies and melts their hearts, and the leaders decide to share the new land, naming it [[Equestria]].

In the season five episode [[Hearthbreakers]], the [[Friendship Express]] train offers "Chancellor Puddinghead puddings" to passengers.
