:'''[Crystal Ponies]'''
::When the Crystal snow gets icy and chilly,
::Join voices with every colt and every filly!
::There's only one solution,
::And we've made a resolution.
::We'll lift our spirits to the sky,
::Our hearts grow full and our hooves rise up high.
::Hooves cold, hearts warm; cold hooves, warm hearts!
::Hearts and Hooves Day, we all take part.<section end="song"></section>
