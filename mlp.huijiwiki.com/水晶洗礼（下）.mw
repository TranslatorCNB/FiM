==概要==
===冬天的侵袭===
[[File:Storm clouds surrounding the Crystal Empire S6E2.png|thumb|乌云笼罩在帝国的地平线上。]] 随着[[Crystal Heart|水晶爱心]]的破碎，[[Crystal Empire|水晶帝国]]失去了保护，Arctic North的wintry fury开始侵袭。当厚厚的积雪云入侵，[[Rainbow Dash]]说她可以赶走那些云，但是[[Princess Celestia]]和[[Princess Luna]]告诉她风暴过于强大，不是她能对付的。

回到Sunburst的屋子，[[Starlight Glimmer]]和[[Sunburst]]的友谊仍然没有被很好地修复。[[Spike]]看了[[Twilight Sparkle]]的列表后，建议他们互相分享一个自己过去的故事。Starlight和Sunburst都很紧张，不同意此意见，Starlight决定不再打扰Sunburst的“重要工作”，拖着Spike离开了屋子。

当Celestia和Luna正在用她们的魔法拖延风暴的逼近，[[Applejack]]、[[Fluttershy]]和[[Rainbow Dash]]开始说服[[Crystal Ponies|水晶小马]]们疏散以躲避风暴。Twilight和她其余的朋友正在赶往城堡图书馆去找一个修复水晶爱心的咒语，并阻止天角兽宝宝仍然未受控制的魔法。

===尝试爱心的重建===
[[File:Applejack, Rainbow, and Fluttershy in front of the crowd S6E2.png|thumb|left|小马们，向前走。这里什么都看不见。]] Starlight哀叹她未能完成Twilight的友谊课程，认为Sunburst不想成为她的朋友。Spike向Starlight保证Twilight想成为她的朋友，而Sunburst也是如此。最后他们注意到了帝国的怪天气，Starlight和Spike认为水晶爱心出事了，他们开始赶往宫殿。

在宫殿前，Applejack、Fluttershy和Rainbow Dash试图说服水晶小马们回家，但是群众拒绝了，尤其是当他们得知新皇家宝宝是一只[[Alicorns|天角兽]]时。在图书馆里，Twilight和[[Princess Cadance]]正在寻找一条可以修复水晶爱心的咒语，而[[Pinkie Pie]]、[[Rarity]]和[[Shining Armor]]正在控制活跃的宝宝。

[[File:Twilight "that was even close to what we needed!" S6E2.png|thumb|噢，这下可不好了。]] Starlight和Spike到达并看见里面一片混乱，且Pinkie Pie快速告诉了他们现在的情况。Twilight和Cadance最后找到了一个叫“遗物重建法”的咒语，可以重建水晶爱心，但宝宝却不小心把法术书炸出了一个洞。

随着外面的风暴恶化，Twilight开始尝试根据记忆重写咒语，而Shining Armor则开始组织帝国的疏散。当Starlight提到了Sunburst且声称他是一个“重要的大魔法师”时，Cadance建议Starlight带他到城堡协助。

===帝国的疏散===
[[File:Crystal Pony crowd gasp S6E2.png|thumb|left|Shining Armor正在组织帝国的疏散。]] Starlight和Spike回到了Sunburst的屋子，Starlight告诉了他现在的情况。大家正在一起修复水晶爱心，Starlight想寻求Sunburst的帮助。Sunburst紧张地拒绝了，说他有太多的“重要的法师工作”要做。

回到宫殿，水晶小马群众依然拒绝离开。当Shining Armor出现并揭示水晶爱心已经破碎时，他们才愿意撤离。Shining Armor开始带着水晶小马们逃向火车站。

[[File:Sunburst feeling down S6E2.png|thumb|Sunburst揭示了真相。]] 经过Starlight的催促，Sunburst最终承认他不是一个重要的魔法师，没有Starlight所相信的拥有很强的魔法天赋。他继续承认，他是一个在Celestia的[[School for Gifted Unicorns]]失败的学生，Starlight也含泪揭示了她以前的错误。Sunburst为他没有告诉Starlight真相而道歉。Starlight原谅了她，并提醒他，帝国正在疏散。

''翻译''：

{{Quote|除非你有一个咒语，可以赶走Frozen North并修复水晶爱心，那样宝宝就可以继续她的Crystalling了？|Starlight Glimmer}}

Sunburst翻找了他的藏书，心生一计。

===Crystalling危机===
由于Celestia和Luna无法继续镇压住乌云，小马们开始跑向火车站。在路上，他们遇到了声称知道如何解决这一切的Starlight和Sunburst。

[[File:Sunburst "to clear away the snow" S6E2.png|thumb|left|Sunburst心中有了答案。]] 在宫殿前，Twilight和Cadance尝试用重写的遗物重建法魔咒去修复水晶爱心，但很不幸，失败了。就在这时，Sunburst到达并伸出了援助之手。他建议继续天角兽宝宝的Crystalling，并与Starlight、Shining Armor和公主们的魔法结合。随着Twilight用魔法浇筑水晶爱心，Shining Armor和Cadance任用Sunburst为仪式的Crystaller。

当Twilight、Starlight、Celestia和Luna用她们的魔法浇筑水晶爱心，Sunburst、Cadance和Shining Armor开始继续宝宝的Crystalling。水晶小马们的光和爱引注到了一个水晶上，接着Sunburst将它与水晶爱心合并。产生的魔法爆炸修复了水晶，且给予了帝国里的每一匹小马一层水晶外衣，解除了风暴。

===友谊与飘雪===
Starlight为Sunburst想出了解决水晶帝国危机的办法而赞扬了他，Princess Celestia表达了她的喜悦，Sunburst终于能够使用他独特的礼物。

[[File:Twilight Velvet holds Flurry Heart S6E2.png|thumb|Twilight的双亲见到了他们的孙子。]] 一段时间后，Twilight和Shining Armor的父母[[Twilight Velvet和Night Light]]抵达了帝国，他们的火车被风暴延迟了。当Twilight Velvet问宝宝的名字是什么时，Cadance和Shining Armor给他取了名叫[[Flurry Heart]]，以纪念这些难忘的时刻。同时，Starlight Glimmer和Sunburst终于重新燃起他们的友谊，并同意保持联系。

回[[Ponyville]]的路上，Twilight叹息她没有给她的第一个学生一堂正确的[[友谊报告#The Crystalling - Part 2|友谊课程]]，但Spike向她保证，这一切会发生是因为Twilight给了Starlight空间去自己做决定——就像Celestia之前教她一样。此集的末尾以Starlight在去往Ponyville的[[Friendship Express|友谊快车]]里向Sunburst挥手而告终。

{{Maintranscript}}
:'''Sunburst''': I know Princess Twilight is keen on the two of us rekindling our friendship, but... it's been so long. I don't see how anything on that list is going to help.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I know, right? It's not like there's some spell that would magically compel us to pick up where we left off.
:'''Sunburst''': Well, actually, there's several. Mist Mane's Material Amity, Rockhoof's Rapport, Flash Prance's Fellow... ship... [ahem] But I-I get the feeling the princess isn't looking for a spell.

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Uh, yeah! We should just get out of your mane. It's pretty obvious this isn't going how Twilight hoped, and I'm sure you have plenty of important work to do...
:'''Sunburst''': What? Oh! Right, yes, heh-heh! Uh, no rest for the wizardly.

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': It's not the list, Spike. Or you. Or Twilight. ''I'm'' the one Sunburst doesn't want to be friends with.
:'''Spike''': I don't remember him saying he didn't want to be friends.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': He didn't have to say it.
:'''Spike''': Well, Twilight obviously thinks you're worth being friends with! And I do too!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Thanks, Spike. At least I have two friends, even if one of them has dragon breath.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Look, I am a hundred percent sure the Crystalling ''isn't'' happening.
:[magic zaps]
:'''Mustache Crystal Pony''': No Crystalling, huh? Then why are they starting the fireworks show?

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What is going on?!
:'''Pinkie Pie''': You want the long or the short version?
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Short?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': [quickly] The baby's an Alicorn and she accidentally destroyed the Crystal Heart, so Twilight and Cadance are looking for a spell to put it back together and save the Crystal Empire from turning into a giant wasteland of ice and snow.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Oh.

:'''Princess Cadance''': Do you think you can remember the spell?
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I only read it through once!
:'''Rarity''': Well, if anypony can exactly remember something she read for the first time two minutes ago, it's you, Twilight.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': I'll try. But I'm not sure how long it'll take.
:[wind blowing]
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Is quickly an option?

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Come on, it's ''freezing'' out here!
:'''Stubborn Crystal Pony''': Uh, this is the Crystal Empire. We've seen snow before.

:'''Stubborn Crystal Pony''': It's not safe here!
:'''Applejack''': [groan] That's what we've been tryin' to tell you!

:'''Sunburst''': [sighs] Look, Starlight, I want to help. I do. But I can't. I wish I could.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': What do you mean?!
:'''Sunburst''': Fixing an ancient relic? I-I can't even come close to doing something like that!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': But I thought you were an important wizard!
:'''Sunburst''': Well, you were wrong, okay?! I'm not an important wizard! I'm not even a wizard at all!

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Sunburst, I don't care if you're a wizard or not. I'm just surprised. You always knew so much about magic. I mean, look at all these books!
:'''Sunburst''': Yeah, well, reading about magic is one thing, but you don't know what it was like at magic school! To know so much and not be able to do any of it!
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Well, ''you'' don't know what it was like to be left behind! And then getting so bitter that you steal the cutie marks from an entire village and then get defeated by Twilight and her friends, so you travel through time to get back at them, but they beat you again and teach you about friendship, but you're so terrified ponies will find out what you did that you can't make any friends!
:[long beat]
:'''Sunburst''': Did you really travel through time?

:'''Night Light''': You would not believe the ''crazy'' weather that delayed our train. Came out of nowhere.
:'''Twilight Velvet''': But it was all worth it to see this peaceful little angel! Awww, so sweet! Come to your grandmare!

:'''Twilight Velvet''': Cadance, darling, aren't we gonna name the poor little dear, or are we gonna spend our entire visit just calling her "the baby"?
:'''Princess Cadance''': We were thinking... "Flurry Heart".
:'''Shining Armor''': You know, to remember the occasion.
:'''Rarity''': Oh, goodness, how could anypony forget?

:'''Starlight Glimmer''': Well, I think you're the Crystal Empire's big important wizard, whether you like it or not.
:'''Sunburst''': I don't know if I'll have time for any wizarding. I'm a crystaller now. That's a big responsibility.
:'''Starlight Glimmer''': I can't think of anypony more qualified. Just... promise you'll stay in touch?
:'''Sunburst''': Hm, like I'd ever lose touch with my oldest friend.
