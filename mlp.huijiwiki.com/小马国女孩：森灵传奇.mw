==发展与制作==

《森灵传奇》于2015年8月在孩之宝的2016年娱乐计划被首次提出，其中包括了新角色[[嘉兰金菊]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equestriadaily.com/2015/08/equestria-girls-legends-of-everfree.html|title=Equestria Girls: Legends of Everfree Highlighted in Hasbro's 2016 Entertainment Plan, Plus Season 6|author=Sethisto|publisher=Equestria Daily|date=2015-08-04|accessdate=2016-02-12}}</ref>的一张图片。

==剧情==
===心中的梦魇===
[[File:Midnight Sparkle clawing at the air EG4.png|缩略图|"I'll be back, Twilight!"]]
电影以[[人类暮光|暮光闪闪]]在噩梦中的挣扎开场，直到她[[坎特拉高中]]的朋友到来并告诉她去往[[森灵营地]]的巴士马上就要出发才醒过来。就在暮光急急忙忙收拾行李的时候，她的第二人格午夜闪闪突然出现在了房屋中。午夜闪闪分水暮光的朋友和整个卧室并洋洋得意的告诉暮光她永远是她身体的一部分。

这时，宠物狗[[Spike (EG)|斯派克]]叫醒了惊声尖叫的暮光，她这才发现刚刚的经历都是一场噩梦，而暮光和朋友们早就搭上了巴士。余晖关心的问道有没有事，而暮光强颜欢笑的说自己很好。正当[[人类萍琪|萍琪]]幻想着野营的乐趣时，[[塞拉斯蒂娅校长]]和[[露娜副校长]]告诉学生她们为学生们自己为野营募集到足够的资金感到自豪。作为在森灵营地有过美好回忆的她们，也希望她们的学生有自己的回忆。

在学生们的欢呼中，暮光忧心忡忡的望向了窗户外的远地方。

===欢迎来到森灵营地===
[[File:Campers listening to the loudspeaker EG4.png|thumb|left|The Wondercolts arrive at Camp Everfree.]] 刚到营地，学生们就开始计划自己丰富的营地活动。比如[[人类小蝶|小蝶]]想野外徒步，斯派克想追逐松鼠。Upon arriving at Camp Everfree, the students start to ponder about the various activities they look forward to, such as going on nature walks for [[Fluttershy (EG)|Fluttershy]] and chasing squirrels for Spike. [[Applejack (EG)|Applejack]] and her friends also express how glad they are to be away from the magical going-ons at Canterlot High. As [[Flash Sentry (EG)|Flash Sentry]] hands Twilight her bag, the two act awkwardly around each other, and Sunset explains it is because of her resemblance to [[Twilight Sparkle|Princess Twilight Sparkle]] of [[Equestria]], who Flash has a crush on.

Over the camp's P.A. system, a cheerful voice directs the campers to the courtyard. The voice belongs to the camp director and "friendly nature guide" [[Gloriosa Daisy]], who introduces herself and her brother [[Timber Spruce]]. The cheery Gloriosa invitingly welcomes suggestions from the campers for activities to make their time at camp memorable. She states that their options are wide open, though Timber interrupts and says hiking near the rock quarry is off-limits. As Gloriosa takes activity suggestions, including a fashion show proposed by [[Rarity (EG)|Rarity]], Timber appears to take a romantic interest in Twilight, causing her to blush.
[[File:Timber always be invited to fun things EG4.png|缩略图|Gloriosa Daisy and Timber Spruce.]]
When Principal Celestia mentions the traditional "camp gift", Gloriosa explains – after some brief tension with her brother – that every year, campers create a gift to leave behind for future campers and foster strong bonds of friendship. After Gloriosa and Timber hand out tent assignments to the campers, Timber Spruce briefly flirts with Twilight, earning her some playful teasing from her friends.

Just then, businessman [[Filthy Rich]] arrives at the camp, prompting Gloriosa to turn him away. When Filthy explains that he's "taking in the scenery", Gloriosa bitterly tells him to return when camp is over. After a brief stare-down between the two, Filthy leaves in his limo. Before the campers get suspicious, Gloriosa claims that Filthy is a former camper who was just visiting.

===Secrets all around===
A short while later, the campers put their belongings away in their assigned tents, and Rarity starts to plan out her fashion show, much to Applejack's chagrin. Meanwhile, Sunset shares with Twilight her suspicions concerning Gloriosa Daisy – and teases her further about Timber Spruce. When Sunset brings up Twilight's behavior back on the class bus, Spike reveals that Twilight has been having nightmares. However, Twilight insists that she has been much happier since transferring to Canterlot High, especially after the events of the [[Friendship Games (event)|Friendship Games]]. Sunset assures Twilight that what happened during the Games was not her fault and that her friends have forgiven her.
[[File:Objects float in Twilight and Sunset's tent EG4.png|左|缩略图|Something magical this way comes.]]
Before heading to the camp docks, Sunset looks for her sunscreen. Twilight finds it but inadvertently levitates it off the ground, along with several other objects in the tent. While Sunset reacts to this magical phenomenon positively, Twilight fears that it's Midnight Sparkle's doing. After having Sunset promise not to say anything about this to their friends, she hurries to the docks. Sunset tries to levitate the sunscreen bottle herself, but nothing happens.

As Sunset goes to join the others at the docks, she bumps into Gloriosa Daisy. Her hand brushes against Gloriosa's arm, and she briefly hears what sounds like Gloriosa's angered voice, but Gloriosa insists she didn't say anything.

===The Wondercolts' camp gift===
Once the campers have gathered at the docks, Gloriosa once again reminds everyone to ask her for anything they might need. When Twilight steps onto the dock, she trips when one of the wooden boards breaks, but Timber Spruce catches her. As Timber continues to flirt with Twilight, Flash Sentry watches forlornly. He confides in Sunset that he shouldn't be jealous because this Twilight isn't the Twilight he knows. Sunset plainly tells him that Twilight's princess duties will keep her busy in Equestria and that he should get over her.
[[File:Vice Principal Luna I suggest we close down the dock EG4.png|缩略图|A dilapidated dock threaten to put a damper on things.]]
Realizing the poor condition of the dock, Vice Principal Luna suggests closing it for the remainder of camp, much to the campers' disappointment. As Gloriosa tries to salvage things, Applejack suggests building a new dock as the Wondercolts' camp gift. Everyone is on board with the idea, but Timber is skeptical, leading to more quiet tension between him and Gloriosa. Nevertheless, the campers all agree to help build a new dock, and Twilight and her friends share their ideas to make it a reality. Rarity, in particular, hopes to use the finished dock as the runway in her fashion show.

As the sun starts to set and Twilight and Timber grow closer, Principal Celestia and Gloriosa tell everyone to clean up and gather by the fire pit for s'mores and scary stories.

===The legend of Gaea Everfree===
[[File:Gaea Everfree giving Old Spice and Dove a warning EG4.png|左|缩略图|The legend of Everfree herself.]]
Later that evening, the campers gather around a campfire, and Timber Spruce tells the legend of a spirit called Gaea Everfree. Many years ago, Timber and Gloriosa's great-grandparents came to the forest and, taken by its beauty, decided to establish a camp. When they started building, however, magical vines began to grow everywhere, and a tree crashed on top of their cabin in the middle of the night. As they ran outside, they encountered a giant creature with root-like hair, teeth made of jagged rock, black eyes, and a shimmering aura that left a trail of gem dust in her wake.

The creature introduced herself as Gaea Everfree, an ancient spirit who held domain over the forest, and that Timber's great-grandparents had trespassed upon her land. They begged Gaea Everfree to let them stay and build their camp. Gaea agreed but warned that it would only be temporary; one day she would return to reclaim the forest, and they will know she is near by her trail of gem dust.
[[File:Twilight Sparkle I'm gonna turn in EG4.png|缩略图|SOME offense taken.]]
At that moment, Gloriosa Daisy emerges from the bushes, scaring the campers. When asked why she made such an entrance, Gloriosa nervously replies that she "took the scenic route" to enjoy the forest. With scary stories drawn to a close, Applejack assures Fluttershy that the story isn't real, but [[Rainbow Dash (EG)|Rainbow Dash]] thinks that Gaea Everfree's presence in their world could be attributed to a similar reason as that of [[the Dazzlings]]'. As the Rainbooms discuss having to deal with another "power-crazed magical creature", a visibly upset Twilight excuses herself, and Sunset tells her friends to be more sensitive about Twilight's feelings in regards to the Friendship Games.

===[[The Midnight in Me]]===
That night, Twilight has another nightmare about Midnight Sparkle's imminent return. Her scream of terror wakes up Sunset, who discovers Twilight magically levitating her and Spike's beds. When Twilight realizes what she is doing, the magic stops, and the beds fall to the floor. Sunset says that they need to talk about what's happening, but Twilight insists that they don't.
[[File:The campers' dock is destroyed EG4.png|左|缩略图|A magical mishap ruins the Wondercolts' hard work.]]
Later that morning, [[Derpy (EG)|Derpy]] and [[Sandalwood]] are in a sailboat on the water, but there's no wind to carry their sail. As Sunset and Twilight arrive to continue working on the new dock, Sunset proposes that Twilight try and control her magic, but Twilight thinks she'll never be able to control it. Just then, Derpy and Sandalwood's sailboat moves forward at high-speed and crashes into the dock, ruining the campers' hard work. According to Sandalwood, the boat moved on its own, and Rarity discovers a trail of gem dust in the water, leading the campers to believe that Gaea Everfree is the cause.

As the campers attempt to salvage what they built, Twilight runs off into the forest alone, feeling guilty for destroying the dock. In a waterfall clearing, she sings an emotional ballad about her struggle to keep the darkness inside her from getting out.

{{Quote|They mustn't see the midnight in me...|Twilight Sparkle}}

[[File:Twilight sees Midnight Sparkle in her reflection EG4.png|thumb|Twilight fears the darkness within.]] Some time later, Sunset looks for Twilight after she disappeared from the dock. She wakes up Spike from his slumber and asks if he knows where Twilight is, and Spike offers to help track her down. Meanwhile, back in the forest, Twilight bumps into Timber Spruce. She pretends to have gotten lost while going for a walk, and Timber guides her back to camp. Timber tells Twilight that he has lived at the camp his whole life and wants to sell it to go live in a normal town. Having never told this to anyone before, Timber says Twilight must be special, and the two of them blush.

Overhearing Twilight and Timber's conversation, Sunset decides to talk to Twilight about her magic at a later time.

===A new kind of magic===
[[File:Rarity pushes Applejack back with a diamond shield EG4.png|左|缩略图|Rarity discovers new shield-making powers.]]
Back at camp, Rarity prepares to partake in rock-climbing, with Applejack as her spotter. When Twilight and Timber return, the increasingly impatient Rainbow Dash asks Twilight to be her spotter so she can join in. As she leaves to get another rock-climbing harness and Timber leaves to assist Gloriosa, Sunset and Spike arrive just as the earth starts to tremble. [[Bulk Biceps]], Flash Sentry, and Derpy notice another trail of gem dust. Distracted by the sudden tremor, Rarity loses her grip on the rock-climbing wall and demands to come down. As Applejack tries to loosen a snag in the harness line, her hands start to glow, and she pulls on the line so hard that Rarity shoots upward. Applejack catches her before she hits the ground, explaining that for a brief moment, Rarity felt inexplicably weightless.

Applejack offers to help Rarity remove her harness, but Rarity refuses and accidentally creates a large diamond shield that pushes Applejack backward into the water. Rarity apologizes profusely, confused over what happened. Sunset is excited that more of her friends are developing new magic, but Twilight is still distressed. After informing Gloriosa about Applejack falling into the water, they hear Fluttershy screaming in the camp cafeteria. There, they find the cafeteria covered in dough and sprinkles. Pinkie Pie explains that, while they were decorating cookies, the sprinkles in Pinkie's hands would glow pink and explode.

[[File:Fluttershy with multiple birds perched on her arms EG4.png|thumb|Fluttershy learns to communicate with animals.]] Fluttershy decides to clean up the mess. When she is unable to reach paper towels on top of a shelf, she asks for help. [[Constance|A bird]] suddenly flies in and fetches the paper towels for Fluttershy, and Fluttershy discovers she is able to communicate with the bird. Applejack and Rarity enter to explain what happened at the rock-climbing wall, and Applejack wonders where Rainbow Dash is. Just then, Rainbow zooms in at supersonic speed and crashes into a wall. She explains she had gone to get a harness, but she ran so fast that she found herself all the way back in town. She also says that she lost her super-speed while so far away, but it returned to her when she got close to camp.

{{Quote|Being at camp is giving us all new magical abilities!|Pinkie Pie}}
[[File:Rainbow Dash crashes into a wall EG4.png|左|缩略图|Rainbow Dash discovers super-speed.]]
As Sunset Shimmer wonders what is causing this magical disturbance, Fluttershy suggests it's the work of Gaea Everfree. At that moment, Gloriosa enters with towels and dry clothes for Applejack. When she asks what happened to the cafeteria, Sunset gives a vague answer, but Gloriosa tells them not to worry about it, once again assuring the campers that she has a handle on things. However, Sandalwood and Derpy enter with additional camp problems, and Timber arrives to inform Gloriosa that Filthy Rich has returned. Again, Gloriosa says she can handle it, but when she puts her hand on Sunset's arm, Sunset hears a scream of frustration. She believes it to have come from Fluttershy, but no one else heard anything.

Before Sunset can figure out what she heard, Principal Celestia uses the camp's P.A. system to announce the lighting of paper lanterns, and the girls decide to forget about their new magic for the time being.

===It's all in the mind===
[[File:Sci-Twi infecting my friends EG4.png|缩略图|"I think it's Midnight Sparkle. She's still part of me."]]
As the campers construct paper lanterns at the picnic tables by the dock, Twilight sits off by herself because she believes Midnight Sparkle is the cause of her and her friends' new magic. When the time comes to release the lanterns, Twilight bumps into Timber Spruce again, and he senses her odd behavior. Twilight tells him she's fine, and she indeed feels a little better when her own lantern is lit.

Later that night, after the campers have gone to sleep, Sunset awakens to find Twilight's bed empty and her belongings gone. Outside the tent, she sees Twilight and Spike leaving and follows after them. When Sunset catches up with them in the forest, Twilight explains that she and Spike are going to catch a cab ride home. As she tries to convince Twilight not to leave, Sunset touches her arm, causing her to experience a vision of Twilight's memories and emotions. Sensing Twilight's uncertainties about Midnight Sparkle, Sunset assures her that Midnight Sparkle is gone.
[[File:Sunset Shimmer has her first empathic vision EG4.png|左|缩略图|Sunset Shimmer develops telepathic empathy powers.]]
With this, Sunset realizes that her own magic has changed as well; she can read others' thoughts, memories, and feelings through physical contact. Unfortunately, this only distresses Twilight further, as she believes more and more people are becoming "infected" by her magic. Despite Sunset's assertions that she knows what Twilight is going through, Twilight is still uncomfortable being around her friends.

Just then, Timber Spruce appears before the two holding a sharp axe. He claims to have been chopping firewood for the following evening's campfire and expresses his growing frustration with his sister's demands. When asked why they were in the woods in the middle of the night, Sunset pretends to have been sleepwalking and being found by Twilight. As Timber escorts Twilight and Sunset back to camp, offering to "protect" them from Gaea Everfree, Sunset discovers gem dust falling out of Timber's pocket.

{{Quote|I think we just found our 'Gaea Everfree'.|Sunset Shimmer}}

===[[Embrace the Magic]]===
[[File:Equestria Girls and Wondercolts on the completed dock EG4.png|缩略图|The Wondercolts' dock is completed.]]
The next morning, the campers continue working on the new dock. Applejack and her friends are being extra careful not to activate their new magic powers, causing their progress to be slow. With the girls unable to control their developing abilities, Sunset Shimmer arrives and tells them they should accept their new magic and not reject it. Through an uplifting song, Sunset teaches her friends to embrace their abilities in order to have better control over them.

With Sunset's guidance, the girls are able to use their magic to speed up and finish the dock's construction. Reinvigorated, Rarity wants to do an immediate run-through of the fashion show. Sunset tells them to start without her so she can find Twilight, hoping to convince her to embrace her own magic. Along her way to find Twilight, Sunset hears Gloriosa Daisy and Timber Spruce arguing in the boathouse; in particular, she hears Timber tell Gloriosa that she has to "let it go", believing he's referring to selling Camp Everfree.
[[File:Flash Sentry you're so much nicer EG4.png|左|缩略图|Flash has a heart-to-heart with Sunset.]]
Gloriosa storms out of the boathouse, with Timber following shortly after. As Sunset sneaks away before she gets caught, she bumps into Flash Sentry, and he thanks her for convincing him to get over Princess Twilight. Noticing Sunset's shifty behavior, Flash asks her what's going on, and she lets him know – as vaguely as possible – that Timber Spruce is not what he seems and she fears revealing his true nature would break Twilight's heart. Though he is unaware of the full situation, Flash says Twilight is lucky to have a friend like Sunset looking out for her. Flash also expresses how much nicer Sunset has become since she first arrived and asks her if they could start over as friends. Sunset, noticing Timber Spruce go into the forest, quickly agrees to Flash's suggestion before running off.

===The truth of Gaea Everfree===
[[File:Sunset and Twilight shocked to see Gloriosa Daisy EG4.png|缩略图|Gloriosa Daisy's secret is exposed.]]
As Sunset follows Timber through the forest, she briefly feels the earth tremble again. Nearby, she sees a shadowy figure enter a cave by the supposedly off-limits rock quarry. She also sees something glowing inside the cave. Convinced that Timber Spruce is up to something, Sunset sends Twilight a text message saying to meet her by the quarry. When she and Spike arrive, Sunset explains to them that she believes ''someone'' is hiding sinister activities behind the guise of a ghost story.

Twilight, Sunset, and Spike enter the cave, where they discover a massive crystal spire emanating with Equestrian magic. Spike mentions Timber Spruce, and Twilight wonders what he has to do with anything. Suddenly, someone emerges from the shadows – not Timber, as Sunset expected, but Gloriosa Daisy. She accuses Gloriosa of trying to scare everyone away from Camp Everfree, but Gloriosa says she would never do such a thing. As Gloriosa walks past Sunset, Sunset grabs her arm, activating her new magic and allowing her to view Gloriosa's memories.
[[File:Gloriosa Daisy controlling five magic geodes EG4.png|左|缩略图|Gloriosa discovers Equestrian magic.]]
Gloriosa had fallen behind on her payments to Filthy Rich, which meant Filthy would own the land that Camp Everfree is built upon, and he intended to tear the camp down to build a spa resort. Desperate to keep the camp that her great-grandparents founded, Gloriosa begged Filthy for more time to pay, and Filthy gave her until the end of the month. Some time later, as she tearfully wondered what to do, Gloriosa noticed a trail of gem dust leading to the cave, where she discovered seven colored geodes embedded in the crystal spire.

Extracting five of the geodes granted Gloriosa magical plant-controlling powers. Timber Spruce tried to warn Gloriosa against using the geodes' power, but Gloriosa refused to listen out of her desire to save Camp Everfree. Unfortunately, she had not mastered her powers completely, having caused Derpy and Sandalwood's boat to crash into the pier and the tremors. This caused even further arguments between Gloriosa and Timber, who made up the Gaea Everfree legend to cover for her actions.
[[File:Gloriosa Daisy with piercing tar-like eyes EG4.png|缩略图|Gloriosa undergoes a wicked transformation.]]
Sunset's visions stop there, and she realizes when Timber told Gloriosa to "let it go", he was referring to the geodes' magic. Sunset and Twilight try to convince Gloriosa to stop using the magic of the geodes before it becomes too much for her to control. Gloriosa refuses, however, still determined to save her camp. She extracts the last two geodes from the crystal spire and uses her increased power to ensnare Twilight, Sunset, and Spike in vines. The geodes then merge with the ones Gloriosa already has, causing her to transform into a green-haired plant-controlling she-demon. With her magic powers, Gloriosa traps the three inside the cave.

===Gloriosa on the warpath===
Back at the camp docks, Rarity is in the middle of her fashion show dress rehearsal when the transformed Gloriosa Daisy appears, to the campers' shock and horror. Determined to keep Camp Everfree out of Filthy Rich's clutches, Gloriosa uses her immense magical power to enclose the entire campground in a giant cage of brambles. Once again, the campers' new dock is destroyed.
[[File:Gloriosa Daisy standing atop the camp sundial EG4.png|左|缩略图|"We will stand for Everfree!"]]
Through [[We Will Stand For Everfree|a villainous aria]], Gloriosa vows to keep Camp Everfree open and protect everyone and everything within its walls, oblivious to the fear that she is instilling into her campers. Timber tries to free the entrapped campers by cutting through Gloriosa's brambles with his axe, but every vine he cuts through simply grows back denser than before. Before long, Camp Everfree is made into a sea of brambles.

In the sailboat nearby, the Rainbooms wonder what they are going to do, and Rainbow Dash suggests doing what they always do: save the day. Jumping into action, Rarity saves [[Lyra Heartstrings and Sweetie Drops (EG)|Lyra and Sweetie Drops]] from a falling totem pole, Rainbow Dash carries the campers to safety, and Fluttershy, Applejack, and Pinkie Pie use their animal communication, super strength, and explosion powers to make openings leading outside the bramble cage. As they do so, they "pony up", sprouting pony ears and wings. However, Gloriosa Daisy seals the openings back up before they can get through, and she traps campers faster than Rainbow Dash can save them.
[[File:Twilight Sparkle harnesses her magic EG4.png|缩略图|Twilight learns to embrace the magic.]]
Meanwhile, Spike frees himself, Twilight, and Sunset from Gloriosa's vines with his teeth, but they are unable to move the boulder blocking the cave entrance. Sunset again tries to convince Twilight to use her magic, and after some reluctance, she uses a small amount of her magic to move the boulder. Now freed from the cave, Sunset, Twilight, and Spike race back to the campgrounds. Inside the bramble cage, Gloriosa asks why the Rainbooms are fighting her when she's trying to save the camp. Rarity says that while she loves Camp Everfree, she isn't ready to give up her weekly trips to the spa. Hearing Rarity mention the spa sends Gloriosa over the edge, and her power continues to grow. Even the pleas of her brother Timber fall on deaf ears as she traps him in brambles as well.

{{Quote|I appreciate your concern, Timber, ''but I got this!''<nowiki></nowiki>|Gloriosa Daisy}}

===Save Camp Everfree!===
Outside the caged camp, Sunset is unable to penetrate the wall of brambles and tells Twilight to use her magic again. Twilight is afraid of using too much magic and letting Midnight Sparkle take over, but Sunset convinces her to do so for the sake of her friends. Using her magic, Twilight splits the brambles apart for her, Sunset, and Spike to enter.
[[File:Midnight Sparkle you will never control me EG4.png|左|缩略图|"You will never control me! I will always be a part of you!"]]
As Gloriosa enters the final phase of immortalizing herself and Camp Everfree in an enclosure of brambles, Timber once again tries to reach her, but Sunset says she is no longer Gloriosa—just a mindless creature consumed by Equestrian magic. Gloriosa and Timber become completely encased in vines, and even more vines sprout from the ground. The Rainbooms and Spike protect themselves from the vines inside Rarity's diamond shield, but she is unable to hold it for long. Sunset tells Twilight she can destroy the brambles by unleashing the full extent of her magic, but Twilight is still afraid of letting Midnight Sparkle take control. Sunset assures her that she and the rest of their friends won't let that happen.

Inside Twilight's mind, she continues to be haunted by Midnight Sparkle, but her friends appear to lend their trust and support. With a declaration of "I am Twilight Sparkle!", Twilight conquers her fears and embraces the Magic of Friendship within her, and she ponies up as well. Breaking free of Gloriosa's brambles, Twilight tears away the vines keeping Gloriosa enclosed and seizes her geodes. Each of the seven geodes goes to Twilight and one of her friends, granting them all-new magical forms. With their new magic, the girls blast the brambles away in an explosion of light.

[[File:Equestria Girls in their Crystal Guardian forms EG4.png|thumb|A brand new magic is unlocked.]] Timber Spruce and the campers are freed from captivity, and Gloriosa Daisy returns to normal. As Timber hugs his sister, the campers cheer for the Equestria Girls, and the girls discover that the geodes have formed into necklaces. Some time later, the campers work together to fix the damage Gloriosa caused, and Gloriosa apologizes to Celestia and Luna for being so misguided in her efforts to save Camp Everfree. She considers going through with selling the camp to Filthy Rich, but Celestia vehemently disagrees.

Because of what Camp Everfree means to both its past ''and'' present campers, Twilight and Sunset propose reaching out to them to help save it. They and their friends suggest holding a "Crystal Ball" fundraiser in the cave to raise money and save the camp from being sold. While Gloriosa Daisy appreciates the girls' enthusiasm, she is unsure how they are going to plan such a ball in one day. But the Equestria Girls assure her...

{{Quote|We got this!|Equestria Girls}}

===The Camp Everfree Crystal Ball===
[[File:The Rainbooms performing Legend You Were Meant to Be EG4.png|thumb|left|The Rainbooms save the day!]] Over the course of the next day, the Everfree campers decorate the inside of the crystal cave and put together their fundraiser to save the camp, sending invitations to everyone in the town nearby. Interspersed throughout are shots of the Rainbooms – with Twilight providing vocals – performing the song [[Legend You Were Meant To Be]] at the Ball, and photographs of the girls having fun together at camp.

Thanks to the campers' efforts, Camp Everfree is saved, and Filthy Rich walks off defeated. Gloriosa Daisy thanks the Rainbooms for everything they've done and regrets not having simply asked for help in the first place.
[[File:Gloriosa Daisy interrupting the moment EG4.png|缩略图|Gloriosa Daisy: moment killer.]]
A short while later, Timber approaches Twilight and brags about saving the campers from the brambles. Twilight points out that she saved them, but Timber playfully argues that she wouldn't have saved them if ''he'' didn't save ''her'' from falling on the docks. When Twilight says she's glad to have met Timber, he misinterprets it as her saying goodbye, but she accepts his invitation to go out on a date. Just before the two share a kiss, Gloriosa interrupts to introduce Timber to some donors who were friends with their parents.

Timber asks Twilight to save him a dance, and Twilight's friends tease her even more. As the girls wonder about their new magic powers, Sunset Shimmer believes they are tied directly to their crystal necklaces and that they were somehow meant to possess them. Later on, Sunset confesses to still wondering about one thing: where the magic of the geodes came from. Meanwhile, back at Canterlot High School, the stone block where the CHS Wondercolts statue once stood has a crack in the top, and magic from Equestria leaks through...

===Epilogue===
[[File:The Camp Everfree dock is destroyed yet again EG4.png|替代=EQG4截屏|左|缩略图|Cue the sad trombone.]]
In a post-[[Hope Shines Eternal|credits]] scene, the Equestria Girls finish rebuilding the new Camp Everfree dock once more. Pinkie Pie wants to celebrate the dock's completion, but she accidentally causes the confetti and marshmallows she throws onto the dock to explode, destroying it all over again. The girls stare in complete disbelief, and Rarity faints.{{clr}}

:'''Rarity''': [chuckles nervously] Gloriosa, let's just think about this for a moment, shall we? I mean, I think Camp Everfree is absolutely delightful, but I just don't know that I'm quite ready to give up my weekly trips to the spa.
:'''Gloriosa Daisy''': [sweetly] To the spa...? [enraged] ''To the spa?!''

:'''Timber Spruce''': Please, Gloriosa! What you're doing is crazy! You have to listen to me!

:'''Midnight Sparkle''': [laughs] You will never control me! I will always be a part of you!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': [whimpers] Noooo!
:'''Sunset Shimmer's voice''': Twilight, listen to me! You are in charge!
:'''Rarity's voice''': You are a light, darling! A force for good!
:'''Rainbow Dash's voice''': Yeah! You can kick the darkness's butt!
:'''Pinkie Pie's voice''': We're here for you, Twilight!
:'''Applejack's voice''': And we'll be here, no matter what!
:'''Fluttershy's voice''': We believe in you!
:'''Sunset Shimmer's voice''': You... are not... Midnight Sparkle!
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': No! I... am... Twilight Sparkle! And the magic I carry inside me is... the Magic of Friendship!

:'''Spike''': You did it! Whoa. Nice bling.

:'''Rarity''': I almost don't care what they are. They are gorgeous! [gasps] And will totally go with the other collection I was working on for the camp fashion show! [giggles] That's probably cancelled, isn't it?

:'''Gloriosa Daisy''': I admire everyone's enthusiasm. Really, I do. But I-I just don't know how we're going to plan a ball by tomorrow and invite everyone.
:'''Equestria Girls''': We got this!

:'''Rainbow Dash''': I handed out, like, four hundred fliers, set up the stage, ''and'' still had time to pick up pizza! I love my super-speed!

:'''Sunset Shimmer''': There is one thing I'm still wondering about, though.
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': What's that?
:'''Sunset Shimmer''': Where did the magic that hit this cave come from?

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Third time is a charm. Or is it fifth? I've lost track.
:'''Rarity''': All that matters is that the runway is finished.
:'''Applejack''': I think you mean the "dock"?
:'''Rarity''': Oh, to-mah-to, tomato.
