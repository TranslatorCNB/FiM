<section begin="song" />
:'''[Twilight Sparkle]'''
::It used to be so simple
::It was a world I understood
::I didn't know what I didn't know
::And life seemed pretty good

::But now the darkness rises
::From somewhere deep inside of me
::Her power overtakes me
::Can I keep this midnight from getting free?

::If I can stay with the light
::I know I'll be free
::And I can start to be whole
::I can start to be me

::But instead I am struggling
::With all that I see
::And these friends
::Mustn't see the midnight in me!
::The midnight in me!

::They mustn't see the midnight in me...<section end="song"></section>

:'''[Twilight Sparkle]'''
::It used to be so simple, the world I understood.
::I didn't know what I didn't know, and life was so good.
::Then I had to ask questions. The peculiar caught my eye.
::And what I've seen can't be unseen. There is no way to hide.

::Every time I think or feel,
::The monster inside proves to be real.
::Even though I reach for the light,
::I can't escape Midnight.

::Wrestling with the darkness takes its toll.
::It's seen my face; it knows my soul.
::How can I protect my friends,
::Make sure my world doesn't end?

::Even though I reach for the light,
::I can't escape Midnight.﻿<section end="booksong"></section>
