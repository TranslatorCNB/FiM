::A friend for life (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh)
::That's what you are to me (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh)
::A friend for life (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh)
::That's what you are to me (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh)

::I couldn't see what was
::Right there in front of me
::Turned my back
::Got my mind off track
::Yeah
::You saw a world that was
::Something new entirely
::Helped me to see
::All the possibilities

::Oooohhhhh....
::Like a star in the day light
::Or like a diamond at night
::Your light was hidden
::From my sight

::A friend for life (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh)
::That's what you are to me (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh)
::A friend for life (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh)
::That's what you are to me (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh)

::Every friendship is tested
::You say you're sincere
::But it's all unclear now
::But with a word
::Everything changes
::And just like that
::You and I are right back

::Oohhh....
::Like a star in the day light (Star in the day light)
::Or like a diamond at night (Diamond at night)
::Your light will shine
::When the time is right

::A friend for life (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh)
::That's what you are to me (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh)
::A friend for life (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh)
::That's what you are to me (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh)

::When I put my hand out
::And I thought I would fall
::You knew what I needed
::And you came around
::To fix it all

::A friend for life (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh)
::That's what you are to me (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh)
::A friend for life (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh)
::That's what you are to me (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh)
::A friend for life (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh)
::That's what you are to me (ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-ohh)
::Ooohh-wa-ooohh
