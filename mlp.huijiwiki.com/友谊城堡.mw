In a September 2013 presentation held by Hasbro Australia, a slideshow was shown depicting upcoming ''My Little Pony'' and ''Equestria Girls'' [[merchandise]]. One of the slides in the slideshow relating to [[Toys#Rainbow Power|Rainbow Power]] contains the text "QUEST FOR A KINGDOM".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlpmerch.blogspot.com/2014/04/eqg-rainbow-rocks-early-concept-art.html|title=EqG Rainbow Rocks Early Concept Art + Rival Band Name|author=Ossie|work=All About MLP Merch|publisher=Blogger|date=2014-04-04|accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref>

==Kingdom history==
In the chapter book ''[[Chapter books#Twilight Sparkle and the Crystal Heart Spell|My Little Pony: Twilight Sparkle and the Crystal Heart Spell]]'', Twilight has her doubts about "being in charge of the well-being of a kingdom of ponies" and seeks out advice from others. She consults [[Princess Cadance]] and asks her friends for ideas for her "future kingdom".

At the beginning of ''[[My Little Pony Equestria Girls]]'' and its chapter book adaptation ''[[Chapter books#Equestria Girls: Through the Mirror|My Little Pony: Equestria Girls: Through the Mirror]]'', Twilight worries that, now that she's a princess, [[Princess Celestia]] will expect her to lead a kingdom of her own, a possibility that [[Spike]] gets excited about.

On pages 12 and 13 of the {{comic|17}} story ''[[Reflections#Issue #17|Reflections Part 1]]'', Twilight worries that her responsibilities of being a princess will interfere with her magical studies. [[Rainbow Dash]] suggests she be "a magical wonder of the world '''''and''''' a princess with the responsibilities of an entire kingdom on her shoulders", noting that it "can't be '''''that''''' hard".

==剧中描写==
===第四季===
[[File:Mane 6 and Spike enter the throne room S4E26.png|thumb|The castle throne room.]] 
At the climax of the episode [[Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2]], the crystalline tree-castle is created from the [[Chest of Harmony|mysterious chest]] that sprouted at the base of the [[Tree of Harmony]] in [[Princess Twilight Sparkle - Part 2]]. The chest is launched from the tree to a site on one side of [[Ponyville]] where, in a matter of seconds, the tree grows into its full size.

The tree-castle bears some resemblance to the [[Golden Oak Library]], at least the aboveground portion of which is destroyed earlier in the episode by [[Lord Tirek]], but is many times larger and appears to have a multi-level castle in its branches, which includes a great balcony, two spires, and a tower. The structure has at least one banner flying on the side marked with [[Twilight Sparkle]]'s [[cutie mark]], and the top bears a large crystal star. Two sets of five strings of beads hang off the side of the structure much like the white beads that hang off the Tree of Harmony. At the foot is a great golden stair for the two-leaved golden door into the tree's body. Two open lancet windows flank the door.

The lobby's two stairs lead into the castle rooms where lancet two-toned green glass windows and crystalline lathed columns with scrolled tops line the hall decked by a brown rug with scrollwork. At its end is a golden-framed green glass fanlighted door to the throne room where the Mane Six and [[Spike]] each have a crystalline throne about a star-shaped dais on a golden dish on a violet rug with scrollwork. Even with its door are a set of green glass spire lights.

===第五季===
Beginning with the season premiere, the castle takes the Golden Oak Library's place in the [[My Little Pony theme song|theme song]].

[[File:Mane six looking at the map S5E1.png|thumb|left|可爱地图]] In [[The Cutie Map - Part 1]], the castle reacts to the Mane Six's cutie marks, and a crystal platform rises from the center of the throne room and creates a [[Cutie Map|three-dimensional interactive map]] of [[Equestria]]. The map calls the Mane Six to a [[Our Town|remote village]] to solve a friendship problem.

In [[Castle Sweet Castle]], the castle is shown to contain high-rising ceilings, long hallways, and a dining hall that Twilight and her friends hold a pancake breakfast in. To make the castle feel more like a home to Twilight, her friends fashion a gem-lined chandelier from the Golden Oak Library's roots and hang it in the throne room. In addition, [[Rarity]] decorates the dining hall, [[Applejack]] spruces up the kitchen with "rustic farm decor," [[Rainbow Dash]] puts up [[Daring Do]] posters in the library, [[Fluttershy]] places some stuffed animals in Twilight's bedroom, and [[Pinkie Pie]] installs a number of hidden confetti cannons.

In [[Tanks for the Memories]] and [[Make New Friends but Keep Discord]], Spike has his own bedroom in the castle. In [[The Lost Treasure of Griffonstone]], the Cutie Map calls Pinkie Pie and Rainbow Dash to [[Griffonstone]].

Twilight's bedroom first appears in [[Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?]], and the castle library first appears in [[Made in Manehattan]]. In the latter episode, the Cutie Map calls Applejack and Rarity to [[Manehattan]].

In [[Hearthbreakers]], the castle is decked out for Hearth's Warming Eve. In [[Scare Master]], a dangling sign with a crown on it hangs outside, most likely to play up the horror movie cliché of a haunted castle. In [[The Hooffields and McColts]], the Cutie Map calls Fluttershy and Twilight Sparkle to the Smokey Mountains.

In [[The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 1]] and [[The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2|Part 2]], each time [[Starlight Glimmer]] and Twilight alter the timeline, the castle disappears, but the Cutie Map remains due to its connection to the Tree of Harmony.

===第六季===
In [[The Crystalling - Part 1]], it is revealed that the castle is the new home of Starlight Glimmer now that Twilight has taken her on as her pupil. Starlight's bedroom appears in [[Every Little Thing She Does]] and [[To Where and Back Again - Part 1]].

==《彩虹摇滚》中的描写==
[[File:Twilight explains the sirens EG2.png|thumb|《彩虹摇滚》中的城堡图书馆]] Twilight Sparkle and her friends are seen in this castle in ''[[My Little Pony Equestria Girls: Rainbow Rocks]]'', gathering books for the castle's library, when suddenly Twilight notices a book vibrating. The book has Princess Celestia's cutie mark on the cover. She opens it and finds out that her friends from [[Canterlot High School]] are in trouble. Through research, she discovers that three [[Creatures#Siren|sirens]] were banished to the human world by [[Star Swirl the Bearded]]. She makes some adjustments to the [[Crystal Mirror]] from [[My Little Pony Equestria Girls|the first film]] to make it able to open at any time, as opposed to every thirty moons.
