The third season [[Friendship is Magic animated media|episode]] [[Magic Duel]] marks the first use of the term "Alicorn" in the series, and in [[Magical Mystery Cure]] the term is used for the first time to directly refer to winged unicorns, previously referred to as unicorns in earlier seasons' episodes [[Friendship is Magic, part 1]] and [[A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1]].

===《Twilight Sparkle and the Crystal Heart Spell》===
The [[Chapter books|chapter book]] ''[[Twilight Sparkle and the Crystal Heart Spell]]'' describes Twilight's new status in chapter 1, "A Crown Achievement": "Twilight had received her very own set of wings. ''Real'' Pegasus wings! She was officially a part of a special breed of pony called an Alicorn. This meant that Twilight was now able to harness the magical powers of the Unicorns, the flight abilities of the Pegasi, and the strength of a good, true heart of an Earth Pony."

There is an illustration that shows an Alicorn princess mare and an Earth pony prince stallion in the book that the [[Cutie Mark Crusaders]] read in [[Hearts and Hooves Day]].

[[File:Book illustration pegasus unicorn love poison S2E17.png|thumb|left|Book illustration: Hearts and Hooves Day]] [[Pinkie Pie]] briefly dresses up as an Alicorn in the episode [[Magical Mystery Cure]]. In [[The Mysterious Mare Do Well]], the masked Mare Do Well is shown to have a unicorn horn and Pegasus wings, convincing Rainbow Dash that she's an Alicorn. However, it should be noted that she is never seen with both her horn and wings at the same time.

In the episode [[Sonic Rainboom]], Rarity is given wings by a [[magic]] spell temporarily, made of gossamer and morning dew. These wings are similar to those of the flutter ponies from Generation 1.

Discord replaces his wings and antlers with giant pink wings and a giant horn to mock Twilight in [[Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1]].

In the movie ''[[My Little Pony Equestria Girls: Rainbow Rocks]]'', during the climactic battle between the Dazzlings and the Rainbooms, a giant spiritual Alicorn is summoned by Sunset Shimmer, Twilight Sparkle, and the human counterparts of Twilight's Ponyville friends through the magic of friendship. The Alicorn blasts the astral projections of the Dazzlings' true siren forms to dust and shatters their power sources, stripping them of their powers and leaving them to flee in shame and disgrace from the furious students and faculty.

In [[Do Princesses Dream of Magic Sheep?]], [[Big McIntosh]] turns into an Alicorn during Ponyville's shared dream.

[[File:Vase illustration of a Crystalling ceremony S6E1.png|thumb|Two Alicorns on a vase illustration.]] In [[The Crystalling - Part 1]], two female Alicorns are depicted in portrait on a Crystalling vase, bearing resemblances to Twilight Sparkle and Princess Cadance.

In [[Stranger Than Fan Fiction]], one of seven doors in the inner sanctum of the Temple of Chicomoztoc depicts an Alicorn.{{clr}}

===《两姐妹的日记》===
The book ''[[The Journal of the Two Sisters]]'' recounts parts of Princess Luna's and Princess Celestia's diaries. Luna tells of "the Alicorns" who taught Luna and Celestia when they were foals. Celestia tells of [[Star Swirl the Bearded]] who is familiar with Alicorns, and how Alicorns age differently than other ponies, which is why Luna and Celestia remained without cutie marks well into adulthood.

The [[Alicorn Amulet]] is an amulet which features the image of an Alicorn. In the [[Friendship is Magic animated media|episode]] [[Magic Duel]], [[Trixie]] uses it to become a "highest level unicorn", gain immense magical powers, and antagonize the citizens of [[Ponyville]]. [[Twilight Sparkle]] finds out that only the wearer can remove the amulet and tricks Trixie into removing it with a fake amulet of her own in a magic duel.
