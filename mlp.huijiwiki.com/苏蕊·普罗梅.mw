==发展与设计==
苏蕊·普罗梅是一匹穿着一件淡粉色的外衣的紫毛小马。 她的[[可爱标记|可爱标记]]是三角形排列的三色纽扣（颜色分别为紫色，浅绿 和淡黄）。She wears a two-tone blue crossed scarf and a headband holding up her mane in the back. She speaks with a soft but distinct upper-class Manehattan accent, similar to that of [[Applejack]]'s [[Aunt and Uncle Orange]].

During her takeover of the Hub Network's Twitter feed, Meghan McCarthy called Suri Polomare "a fave" due to Tabitha St. Germain's voice performance for the character.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/HubTVNetwork/status/463818725804630016|title=Twitter / Hub Network: My favorite new character appears ...|accessdate=2014-05-06|date=2014-05-06}}</ref>

==剧中描述==
[[File:Suri 'Would you mind...' S4E08.png|thumb|Suri scheming.]]Suri meets [[Rarity]] when she's the last to arrive with her dresses at [[Prim Hemline]]'s rehearsal. She is stated to have met Rarity before at a [[Ponyville]] knitting competition, although Rarity at first cannot put a name to her face. While backstage with Rarity, she takes a look at Rarity's dresses, complimenting her on her designs. Appreciating the material Rarity used to make the dresses, Suri asks Rarity for a swatch of the fabric to fix up some of her own dresses. Rarity happily obliges and gives her an entire roll of fabric.

The next day, Rarity shows up last to the event again. As Rarity peeks onto the stage, she sees Suri having her dresses judged by Prim Hemline. She then notices that Suri had completely duplicated her designs overnight with [[Coco Pommel]]'s help, using the same fabric that she used. When confronted by Rarity about this, Suri explains that "it's everypony for herself in the big city".

When Rarity later rushes back to the plaza to thank Prim for the opportunity, Suri and Coco tell Rarity that Prim is "furious" and that she should stay away from her for a while. Once Rarity's friends turn up, it is revealed that Suri also told them that Rarity lost the competition. After Rarity accepts the defeat and leaves with her friends to see ''Hinny of the Hills'', it is revealed that Suri lied to Rarity and her friends about the competition's outcome and that Rarity had indeed won. Coco states that the deceitful designer had hoped Rarity's failure to claim the prize would allow her to win first place.

[[Twilight Sparkle]] mentions Suri in [[Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1]] in reference to the events of [[Rarity Takes Manehattan]].

Suri Polomare appears talking to [[List of ponies#S05E16 UES8|S05E16 Unnamed Earth Stallion #8]] several times in [[The Gift of the Maud Pie]], twice in the Bridleway theater district and again across the street from [[Maud Pie]] and Pouch Pony.

==《友谊大赛》中的描述==
Suri Polomare's human counterpart appears in ''[[My Little Pony Equestria Girls: Friendship Games]]'' as a student of [[Crystal Prep Academy]]. She first appears on the Crystal Prep bus ride to [[Canterlot High School]], refusing to give a seat to [[Twilight Sparkle (Sci-Twi)|human Twilight]]. At the welcome party for Crystal Prep, she dances next to [[Flash Sentry (EG)|Flash Sentry]] and briefly talks with [[Micro Chips]]. During [[ACADECA]], she is paired with [[Jet Set and Upper Crust|Upper Crust]] in the home economics portion, eventually losing to [[Pinkie Pie (EG)|Pinkie Pie]] and [[Fluttershy (EG)|Fluttershy]]. When [[Principal Cinch]] glares at her disapprovingly, she nervously drops the cake she and Upper Crust made onto the floor.

Before the Friendship Games' final event, she is among other Shadowbolts pressuring Twilight into releasing the magic from her pendant.
