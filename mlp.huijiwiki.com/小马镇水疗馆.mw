Distance shots of [[Ponyville]] place the day spa on the edge of the town square, next to the [[Ponyville#Joke shop|joke shop]]. Externally, the building has yellow walls, a flashy fuchsia roof, a gold door, and a green sign with a depiction of a pony with a wavy gold mane. Its interior has a color scheme consisting mostly of shades of pink, purple, and yellow.

===第一季===
The day spa is first featured in the episode [[Bridle Gossip]]. [[Apple Bloom]] and [[Zecora]] use the spa's bath area to make a herbal bubble bath and cure the [[Characters#Main characters|Mane Six]] of the effects of [[Magic#Magical plants|poison joke]]. Afterward, spa pony Lotus Blossom asks Zecora for the bath's recipe.

In [[Green Isn't Your Color]], [[Rarity]] is a regular customer at the day spa, and she and [[Fluttershy]] have weekly get-togethers there. The two indulge in the spa's steam room, mud facial, massage, seaweed wrap, and hoof bath services—Rarity's "usual" regimen.

===第二季===

===第四季===
In [[Filli Vanilli]], Aloe and Lotus Blossom get [[the Pony Tones]] to perform at the day spa for the spa patrons.

===第五季===
In [[Castle Sweet Castle]], [[Twilight Sparkle]] and Spike spend a day at the spa while Twilight's friends redecorate the [[Castle of Friendship]]. While at the spa, Twilight gets a "super-deluxe mane blow-out" and massage, and Spike gets an "extra-strength-hot-stone-deep-tissue massage" from masseuse [[Bulk Biceps]].

In [[Slice of Life]], the Ponyville Day Spa's external design is altered to have a bluish-green roof, red door, and dark yellow sign. Lotus Blossom styles [[Matilda]]'s mane for her wedding to Cranky Doodle, and [[Steven Magnet]] has a full body soak.

===第六季===

In [[No Second Prances]], [[Starlight Glimmer]] meets [[Trixie]] at the spa while treating herself to a spa day. Trixie comments about the spa, "I'm gonna start coming here every time I visit Ponyville."

In [[Applejack's "Day" Off]], Rarity and [[Applejack]] have spa days together, but they are infrequent due to Applejack's increasing chores. During one of their trips to the spa, Applejack discovers a leak in the piping, and she spends all of her and Rarity's spa time fixing it. Rainbow Dash has also become a regular patron, her usual regimen consisting of "pampered muscle massage and indulgent hooficure", but she is embarrassed when Applejack and Rarity find out. Other notable spa customers in the episode include [[Mr. and Mrs. Cake]] and [[Spoiled Rich]].
