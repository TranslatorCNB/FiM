==歌词==
:'''[Young Fluttershy]'''
::What is this place
::Filled with so many wonders?
::Casting its spell
::That I am now under

:Squirrels in the trees
::And the cute little bunnies
::Birds flying free
::And bees with their honey

::Hooooonneeeeeeey!

:Oooh, what a magical place
::And I owe it all to the Pegasus race
::If I knew the ground had so much up its sleeve 
::I'd have come here sooner, and never leave

::Yes, I love ev-er-ythiiiiing!
