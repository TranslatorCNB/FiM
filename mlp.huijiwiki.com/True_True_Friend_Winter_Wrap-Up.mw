:'''[Gabriela Geneva]'''
::Three months of winter coolness
::And awesome holidays

:'''[Gabriel Brown]'''
::We've kept our hoovsies warm at home
::Time off from work to play
::But the food we've stored is runnin' out
::And we can't grow in this cold

:'''[Gabriela Geneva]'''
::And even though I love my boots
::This fashion's getting old

:'''[Gabriela and Gabriel]'''
::A true, true friend helps a friend in need
::A friend will be there to help you see
::A true, true friend helps a friend in need
::To see the light that shines from a true, true friend

::The time has come to welcome spring
::And all things warm and green
::But it's also time to say goodbye
::It's winter we must clean
::We move the clouds
::And we melt the white snow
::When the sun comes up
::Its warmth and beauty will glow!

:'''[All]'''

::A true, true friend helps a friend in need

::Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up!
::Winter Wrap Up! Winter Wrap Up!
::'Cause tomorrow spring is here

:'''[Gabriela and Gabriel]'''
::Little critters hibernate
::Under the snow and ice
::We must wake up all their sleepy heads
::So quietly and nice
::We help them gather up their food
::Fix their homes below
::We welcome back the southern birds
::So their families can grow!

:'''[Gabriela Geneva]'''
::Now that I know what they all do
::I have to find my place
::And help with all of my heart
::Tough task ahead I face

:'''[All]'''
::How will I do without my magic?
::Help the Earth pony way
::I wanna belong so I must
::Do my best today,
::Do my best today!
