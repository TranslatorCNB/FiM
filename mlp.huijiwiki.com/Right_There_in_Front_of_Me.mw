<section begin="song1"/>
:'''[Sci-Twi]'''
::I spent so much time searchin'
::Lookin' for somethin' more
::Diggin' holes too deep
::And opening every door

::And when you stand too close
::Yeah, the picture's never clear
::And when you look too far away
::It all but disappears

:'''[All]'''
::And it was right (right) there in front of me (Oh-oh, ah-oh-oh)
::Just too close for me to see (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
::Sometimes the things you want
::Are not the things you need
::And it was right there in front of me<section end="song1"></section>

::There was a time before
::I didn't know where I belonged
::I thought I needed more
::And that I couldn't get along

:'''[Sci-Twi and Sunset Shimmer]'''
::But who I am
::Was all I ever needed
::And when I faced that test
::I finally succeeded

:'''[All]'''
::And it was right (right) there in front of me (Oh-oh, ah-oh-oh)
::Just too close for me to see (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
::Sometimes the things you want
::Are not the things you need
::And it was right there in front of me

::Oh, whoa-oh, oh-whoa-oh

::And it's all I'll ever need
