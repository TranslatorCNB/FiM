==电影中的描述==
===[[小马国女孩（电影）]]===
[[File:Rarity_generous-_EG.png|thumb|Rarity in Equestria Girls.]] 在《小马国女孩》中，瑞瑞第一次出场是在[[余晖烁烁]]使用[[暮光闪闪]]在[[坎特拉高中]]的丑照损毁她的形象后。瑞瑞把暮光闪闪拉进一间空教室并给她套上了一件伪装服。

稍后的剧情透露了瑞瑞和暮暮的其他几位新朋友被余晖烁烁挑拨离间，其中她尤其记恨[[人类萍琪|萍琪]]。在暮暮帮助她们五人重归于好后，她们共同帮助暮暮出谋划策为秋季舞会拉选票。瑞瑞想出了一个计划：让同学们统一戴上奇骏团的马耳头饰和马尾腰带以示团结。

当余晖烁烁带上暮光闪闪的皇冠变身成恶魔形态时，When Sunset puts on Twilight's crown and transforms into a "raging she-demon", Rarity briefly channels the [[Elements of Harmony#Rarity – generosity|element of generosity]] and gains pony-like attributes.

According to a crew member, in an early draft of the movie, Rarity was the girl who unsuccessfully ran for Princess of the Spring Fling against Sunset Shimmer, but the final draft of the movie did not reveal this.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allspark.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=93931&st=20&p=2334610&#entry2334610|title=Nayuki on Rarity and Sunset Shimmer|date=2013-06-22|accessdate=2013-08-24}} [[:File:Nayuki on Rarity against Sunset Shimmer.png|Archived locally]].</ref> The crew member also stated that "a couple of lines in the movie" still imply it. In the movie, Fluttershy mentions the unsuccessful candidate for Princess of the Spring Fling when she advises Twilight against running for Fall Formal Princess. Later in the movie, Rarity says she expects "some sort of apology for last spring's debacle."

===[[小马国女孩：彩虹摇滚]]===
[[File:Rarity on purple Better Than Ever backdrop EG2.png|thumb|left|Rarity playing keytar in Rainbow Rocks.]] In ''My Little Pony Equestria Girls: Rainbow Rocks'' and its tie-in [[My Little Pony Equestria Girls: Rainbow Rocks/Animated shorts|animated shorts]], Rarity plays [[Wikipedia:Keytar|keytar]] in her friends' band, [[the Rainbooms]]. She first appears helping her friends make a poster for the [[CHS Musical Showcase]], which she describes as "eye-catching". During a Rainbooms rehearsal, she helps comfort the reformed Sunset Shimmer by saying that she and her friends have forgiven her for what she refers to as Sunset's "past booboos." She is the first to openly talk about how she and the others gain pony ears and a longer ponytail whenever they perform.

Throughout the film and the duration of the Battle of the Bands, Rarity mostly concerns herself with the band's stage costumes, putting at heated odds with [[Applejack (EG)|Applejack]]. When Sunset helps the Rainbooms patch things up, Applejack asks Rarity to provide the costumes for their big "Save the School" performance, and Rarity is more than happy to oblige.

Rarity once again appears with her friends, as equally frustrated as Rainbow Dash and Applejack with Pinkie Pie's escalating drumming.

====[[My Little Pony Equestria Girls: Rainbow Rocks/Animated shorts#Player Piano|Player Piano]]====
[[File:Rarity playing keytar EG2.png|thumb|Rarity discovering a talent for the keytar.]] Rarity tries to move a grand piano to the band room but has great difficulty with the task. She uses her allure to get the [[Diamond Dogs|Diamond Dog boys]] to do it for her. By the time she arrives, making a grand entrance to the band room, her and her friends' allowed time in the band room runs short. Before Rarity is forced to move the piano again, Pinkie Pie recommends she take up the more mobile keytar. As she plays it, Rarity turns into her half pony form.

====[[My Little Pony Equestria Girls: Rainbow Rocks/Animated shorts#A Case for the Bass|A Case for the Bass]]====
Rarity appears with her friends when Applejack bargains with [[Flim and Flam]] for her bass guitar, pointing out that they only paid [[Granny Smith]] two dollars for it and glaring scornfully at them when they try to scam her.

====[[Shake Your Tail]]====
Rarity sings the titular song with her friends and helps set up the auditorium for the Rainbooms' performance, briefly suggesting a masquerade ball theme.

====[[Perfect Day for Fun]]====
Rarity and the rest of the Mane Six go to the Canterlot High school carnival. She spends time at the carnival with Pinkie Pie. They later meet up with the rest of their friends and the end of the short shows them on the Ferris wheel.

====[[Life is a Runway]]====
Rarity is the central focus of the musical short Life is a Runway, having lead vocals in the song. She struts through the city streets impressing everyone she passes with her fashion and magically changing the outfits of [[Derpy (EG)|Derpy]]、[[Lyra Heartstrings and Sweetie Drops (EG)|Lyra Heartstrings and Sweetie Drops]], and [[Cheerilee (EG)|Miss Cheerilee]]. By the end of the short, Rarity has made rows and rows of new outfits for sale at Carousel Boutique.

====[[My Past is Not Today]]====
Rarity briefly appears in a flashback putting her hand on Sunset Shimmer's after her defeat in the first film.

====[[Friendship Through the Ages]]====
Rarity performs the song with the Rainbooms, singing a verse in the style of light pop, and happily interacts with Sunset Shimmer.

===[[小马国女孩：友谊大赛]]===
[[File:Rarity looking behind to Pinkie EG3.png|thumb|left|Rarity competing in the Friendship Games' speed skating event.]] Rarity appears again in ''My Little Pony Equestria Girls: Friendship Games'', competing in the games against [[Crystal Prep Academy]] as part of Canterlot High's Wondercolts team. She participates in the Academic Decathlon, passing the baking contest but failing the spelling bee after misspelling "estuary". She is paired up with Pinkie Pie during the speed skating portion of the Tri-Cross Relay.

Rarity designs an excess of costumes for her friends wear during the games. She ponies up as a result of this burst of generosity, luring the human world's version of [[Twilight Sparkle (Sci-Twi)|Twilight Sparkle]] to them as she follows her magic-detecting device, which drains Rarity of her magic. She later regains her magic to empower Sunset Shimmer and return Twilight to normal after she is transformed into Midnight Sparkle.

====[[My Little Pony Equestria Girls: Friendship Games/Animated shorts#The Science of Magic|The Science of Magic]]====
In this short, Sunset Shimmer attempts to find out how magic works in the human world. She tests it on Rarity by connecting her to several cable-mounted suction cups. Once Rarity plays her keytar, she ponies up and starts floating in the air, causing Sunset to trip over the wires Rarity was connected to.

===[[小马国女孩：森灵传说]]===
[[File:Rarity ponies up as she saves Lyra and Sweetie Drops EG4.png|thumb|Rarity gains the ability to project diamond constructs.]] In the fourth ''Equestria Girls'' film, Rarity goes with her friends and classmates to [[Camp Everfree]], where she expresses a desire to put on a big fashion show. At Camp Everfree, she is paired with Pinkie Pie in the Emerald Tent. While at the camp, Rarity's magic undergoes a dramatic change, and she develops the ability to project transparent diamond-shaped shields.

Throughout the film, Rarity helps her fellow Wondercolts build a new dock for Camp Everfree as part of their "gift for future campers", all while organizing her fashion show. When camp director [[Gloriosa Daisy]] is consumed by Equestrian magic and Twilight Sparkle overcomes her fears of Midnight Sparkle, Rarity helps her friends defeat Gloriosa. She also assists in saving Camp Everfree from closing by organizing a Crystal Ball fundraiser.

<!--===Dance Magic===
The special "Dance Magic" is centered on Rarity as she finds herself in competition with the Shadowbolts in creating a music video to raise money to help repair Camp Everfree.-->

==漫画中的描述==
Rarity appears in [[My Little Pony Annual 2013]]. During her freshman year, she receives a lot of popularity at school for her fashionista style, but this ends up alienating her from her genuine new friends. When [[Applejack (EG)|Applejack]] accidentally spills her lunch on [[Fluttershy (EG)|Fluttershy]], Rarity gives Fluttershy a temporary new outfit to wear, and she learns to be even more generous in the end.

In the [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls Holiday Special]], Rarity takes part in a series of slumber parties for Sunset Shimmer. At one of the slumber parties, she dismisses her little sister [[Cutie Mark Crusaders (EG)|Sweetie Belle]]. Rarity also becomes a victim of cyber-bullying when "Anon-a-Miss" (which Sweetie Belle helped create) posts embarrassing pictures of her on the internet.

===''Equestria Girls'' description===
''Rarity has a passion for fashion and she believes that the best accessory is generosity. That generous spirit and love of all things beautiful makes her a favourite at Canterlot high. When she's not making custom clothing or fabulouzing herself, she's making sure her friends are wearing the latest and greatest outfits that the world has to offer. And with the Fall Formal on the horizon, and Twilight Sparkle in the running for the crown, Rarity has her work cut out for her. But she's always happy to help a friend in need and always there to make them look fabulous.''

Five dolls of Rarity have also been released for ''My Little Pony Equestria Girls: Rainbow Rocks'': a doll with backstage pass; a doll that comes with a hairbrush, keytar, and pony Rarity; a "Neon" doll with backstage pass and headset; a deluxe dress-up doll with accessories; and a "Rockin' Hairstyle" doll with hair extensions.

Another two Rarity dolls have been released for ''My Little Pony Equestria Girls: Friendship Games'': a "Sporty Style" doll with roller skates, and a "School Spirit" doll.

Miniature, articulated dolls of Rarity were released in Winter 2015 as part of the "Equestria Girls Minis" lineup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlpmerch.com/2015/10/equestria-girls-minis-announced-by.html|title=Equestria Girls Minis Announced by Hasbro at NYCC|author=Ossie|publisher=All About MLP Merch|date=2015-10-08|accessdate=2015-11-08}}</ref>

Rarity appears as a [[Ponies|pony]] in [[Equestria]] on the fan-designed WeLoveFine [[Merchandise#Posters|art print]] "Girls in Equestria".

==Personality==
[[File:Rarity surrounded by rows of dresses EG2.png|右|无框]] Like her pony counterpart, Rarity is very generous and has a keen eye for fashion. She disguises Twilight to hide her from the CHS students' ridicule, and she comes up with the idea of handing out pony ears and tails. Rarity also likes doting on the dragon-turned-puppy Spike, finding him "so adorable" and letting him sleep in her lap at the Sweet Shoppe.

Rarity's generosity and love for fashion carry over into the second and third films as well. In ''Rainbow Rocks'', she greatly concerns herself with making a good stage impression, and in ''Friendship Games'', she says putting effort into clothes and spending time on her friends are what she lives for.

Rarity also has a bit of a fascination with royalty, as she is excited to learn that Twilight Sparkle is a princess and has her own castle.
