'''《ACADECA》''' （'''Aca'''demic '''Deca'''thlon） 是《[[小马国女孩：彩虹摇滚]]》六首歌中的第四首。它还是原声专辑《[[My Little Pony Equestria Girls: Friendship Games - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]》上的第六首歌，在专辑中其名字为《'''Acadeca'''》，专辑版本中余晖部分的歌词也与电影中略为不同。在电影中，[[坎特拉高中]]奇骏团与[[水晶预科学院]]暗影团利用本曲来为自己加油打劲以及嘲讽对手。

==制作==
本歌的名字最初出现于 [[Kaylee Johnston]] 的个人网站上。

在电影《彩虹摇滚》的DVD/蓝光版本的评论音轨中，本曲的作者[[丹尼尔·英格拉姆]]提到，本曲最初被写成了一段说唱，但考虑到这样“太过俗气”（really cheesy），便改成了现在的版本。他同时也提到，由于两只队伍的歌唱部分都是由同一个合唱团演唱，为了将其区分开来，合唱团被要求令[[暗影团]]部分听起来“令人厌恶”（really obnoxious），而令[[坎特拉高中|奇骏团]]部分听起来“令人愉快”（really nice）。
