'''《What More Is Out There?》'''（在电影的原声带上其名字为没有问号的 '''《What More Is Out There》''' ） 是《小马国女孩：友谊大赛》六首歌中的第三首，它同时也是原声专辑《 [[My Little Pony Equestria Girls: Friendship Games - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]》中的第七首歌曲。在电影里，人类暮暮在前往严校长的办公室的路上演唱了这首歌。

在电影DVD上播出的删减片段显示，本曲原本的版本是人类暮暮和[[余晖烁烁]]的二重唱，其中，余晖的部分主要表达了她对于自己在[[小马国]]过往生活的怀念之情。

<section begin="song"/>
:'''[Sci-Twi]'''
::I've walked through all these halls before
::I've been in and out of every door, oh-whoa-oh
::There's nothin' in this school that I don't know
::In every class, my grade's the best
::The highest score on every test
::I think that means it's time for me to go

::I know there's more that's out there
::And I just haven't found it yet
::I know there's more that's out there
::Another me I haven't met

::This school is full of people
::But still I don't belong
::They only dream of winning
::Look at me like something's wrong
::Maybe I'm better off alone
::Will I find what I'm lookin' for
::If I just do it on my own?

::I know there's more that's out there
::Something to fill this hole inside
::I know there's more that's out there
::And I'm not afraid to try

::There's only so much this school can offer
::And I'm not saying that it's wrong
::But I know there's more that's out there
::'Cause I've been searching all along

::Beyond these rooms, beyond these walls
::So much to learn, I can't see it all
::There's somethin' out there callin' me
::And it's a mystery that I can't wait to see

::'Cause I know there's more that's out there
::Another place, another way
::And I know there's more that's out there
::And I'll find out someday!

::I'll find out someday...<section end="song"></section>{{clr}}

:'''[Sunset Shimmer]'''
::Everyone here likes who I am
::And it's not from a magic spell's command, oh-whoa-oh
::My friends look past the things I've done before
::But still I miss those quests
::The mythic creatures, magic tests
::High school's great, sure, but who am I anymore?

:'''[Sci-Twi]'''
::It's not that I'm ungrateful or trying to succeed
::But there's something left still missing, something that I need

:'''[Sunset Shimmer]'''
::I know there's more that's out there
::Maybe folks that need my help
::I know there's more that's out there
::Because I've seen it for myself

::There's only so much this town can offer
::And I'm not saying that's so bad
::But I know there's more that's out there
::'Cause it's a life that I once had

:'''[Sci-Twi]'''
::Beyond these rooms, beyond these walls
::So much to learn, I can't see it all

:'''[Sunset Shimmer]'''
::This town is home, this school is safe
::But how can I be home and still feel out of place?

:'''[Sci-Twi]'''
::And I know there's more that's out there
::Another world to explore

:'''[Sunset Shimmer]'''
::And I know there's more that's out there
::Am I wrong for wanting more?

:'''[Sci-Twi and Sunset Shimmer]'''
::And I can't wait for it to happen
::But what it is I cannot say
::I just know there's more that's out there
::And it's calling out my name

::And I'm searching for the answer
::'Cause I feel I've lost my way
::I may not know what's really out there
::But I'll find out someday!

::I'll find out someday...<section end="duetversion"></section>
