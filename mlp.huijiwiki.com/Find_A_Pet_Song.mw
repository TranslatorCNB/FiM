据丹尼尔·英格拉姆所言，本曲的创作受到了1967年美国音乐电影《医生杜立德》（''Doctor Dolittle''）中歌曲"Fabulous P laces"的影响。<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/dannyimusic/posts/263344313713148?comment_id=3327527&offset=200&total_comments=613|title=Daniel Ingram discussing the "Find A Pet Song"|accessdate=2013-05-04|date=2011-11-20}}</ref>本曲的部分旋律被用在了Discovery Family的日间节目网站上的Fluttershy's Songbird Chorus游戏当中。本歌还是[[Songs of Friendship and Magic]] 专辑中的第五首音乐，在该专辑中，本歌曲名字为"'''May the Best Pet Win'''"（与歌曲所在剧集名字相似，只是少了感叹号）。此外，本曲还是唱片专辑 [[Magical Friendship Tour]]  A面的第五首歌。

<section begin="song" />
:'''[Fluttershy]'''
::Now, Rainbow, my dear, I cannot express my delight
::It's abundantly clear
::That somewhere out here
::Is the pet that will suit you just right

:'''[Rainbow Dash]'''
::I can't wait to get started, but first let me set a few rules
::It's of utmost importance
::The pet that I get
::Is something that's awesome and cool

:'''Fluttershy''': Awesome, cool, got it!
::I have so many wonderful choices, just wait, you will see

:'''[Rainbow Dash]'''
::I need something real fast like a bullet to keep up with me

:'''[Fluttershy]'''
::Sure! How 'bout a bunny?
::They're cutesy and wootsie and quick as can be

:'''[Rainbow Dash]'''
::Cutesy? Wootsie? Have you even met me?

:'''[Fluttershy]'''
::Rainbow, have faith
::You see, I will bet you
::Somewhere in here is the pet that will get you

:'''Fluttershy''': Come on, the sky's the limit!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Sky is good. I'd like it to fly.
:'''Fluttershy''': Really? Because I think this widdle puddy tat has your name written all over it. Yes, he does. Aww, look, he likes you!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Pass.

:'''[Fluttershy]'''
::I have so many wonderful choices for you to decide
::There are otters and seals
::With massive appeal

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Otters and seals do not fly.
:'''Fluttershy''': Maybe not, but I've seen this particular seal catch ten feet of air when he breaches the water!
:[seal barks]
:'''Rainbow Dash''': That's it. I'm outta here.

:'''[Fluttershy]'''
::Wait! There must be a pet here
::That will fit the ticket
::How 'bout a ladybug, or a cute cricket?

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Bigger. And cooler.
:'''Fluttershy''': Bigger, cooler. Right.

::I've got just the thing in that tree, Dash
::Meet your new fabulous pet, Squirrely!

:'''Rainbow Dash''': It's just a squirrel.
:'''Fluttershy''': Not just any squirrel. A ''flying'' squirrel!
:'''Rainbow Dash''': ...Yeah. So, like I was saying...

::Fluttershy, pal, this won't cut it
::I need a pet to keep up with me
::Something awesome, something flying
::With coolness that defies gravity!

:'''Fluttershy''': I'm sensing you want an animal that can fly.
:'''Rainbow Dash''': Ya think?

:'''[Fluttershy]'''
::I have plenty of wonderful creatures who soar in the sky
::Like a sweet hummingbird or a giant monarch butterfly

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Better, but cooler.

:'''[Fluttershy]'''
::I see. How 'bout an owl, or a wasp, or a toucan?
::There's so many wonderful creatures the likes of that
::There are falcons and eagles
::They are both quite regal
::Or perhaps what you need is a dark and mysterious bat?

:'''Rainbow Dash''': Now you're talking! But instead of just one standout, now that's too many.

::So many choices, and such riches aplenty

:'''Fluttershy''': Not a bad problem to have, if you ask me.

:'''[Rainbow Dash]'''
::The bat would be awesome, but the wasp I'm digging too
::Do you have something in a yellow striped bat?

:'''Fluttershy''': No.

::I've got a hot pink flamingo, just dying to meet you

:'''[Rainbow Dash]'''
::What to do, what to do? [gasp]
::A prize! That's it! There's really just one way
::To find out which animal's best
::Hold a contest of speed, agility, and guts
::That will put each pet to the test

:'''[Fluttershy]'''
::Don't forget style, that should be considered

:'''[Rainbow Dash]'''
::Then we'll know for sure who's best of the litter

:'''[Fluttershy]'''
::The one who is awesome as cool

:'''[Rainbow Dash]'''
::Just like me
::Can't settle for less, 'cause I'm the best

:'''[Fluttershy''' and '''Rainbow Dash]'''
::So a contest we will see

:'''[Rainbow Dash]'''
::Who's the number one, greatest, perfectest pet

:'''[Fluttershy''' and '''Rainbow Dash]'''
::In the world for me!

:'''[Fluttershy]'''
::May the games

:'''[Fluttershy''' and '''Rainbow Dash]'''
::Begin!

:'''Rainbow Dash''': And may the best pet win!<section end="song"></section>
