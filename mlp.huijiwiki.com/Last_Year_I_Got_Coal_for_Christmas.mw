:'''[Pop Fly]'''
::Last year I got coal for Christmas
::I got put on Santa's naughty list (Again!)
::Put a frog inside my teacher's desk – yeah, that was bad
::But this year, I made sure I won't get missed

::Last year I got coal for Christmas (Man!)
::Didn't do my homework for a week (Okay, a month!)
::But now I studied hard and nearly aced most every test
::So this year's Christmas better be the best

::Spent time with my old granny
::Raking up her lawn
::Took out the garbage every night (Ewww!)
::Helped mama do the laundry
::Cleaned up my room
::Did every single chore in sight – [sigh]

::Last year I got coal for Christmas (Aw, shucks!)
::Every photo I just made a face – [babbling]
::This year when we posed, I smiled sweetly like an angel
::No more taking chances just in case

::Last year I got coal for Christmas (Really?!)
::Ate dessert before my dinner most of the time (Mmm! Cake!)
::But this year I had vegetables with every single bite
::I sure hope this year Santa gets it right (Come on, Santa!)

::Spent time with my old granny
::Raking up her lawn
::Took out the garbage every night (She eats so much!)
::Helped mama do the laundry
::Cleaned up my room
::Did every single chore in sight (Aw, gross!)

::Last year I got coal for Christmas (For crying out loud!)
::I go to bed and never brush my teeth – [exhales]
::Now I bring my toothbrush each and every place I go
::So that tree better got my presents underneath

::This year, no more coal for Christmas (Yes!)
::Santa took me off the naughty list (Woo-hoo!)
::I might keep it up because it's really not so bad
::So Santa, just bring presents
::Please, dear Santa, no more lessons
::Next year, Santa, just bring presents, I insist!

::Seriously.<section end="song" />
