==名字起源==
在为本曲命名时，丹尼尔·英格拉姆尝试征求了自己Facebook访问者们的意见。<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/dannyimusic/posts/270738612973718|title=Daniel Ingram requesting his Facebook visitors to name the Becoming Popular song|date=2011-12-03|accessdate=2011-12-03}}</ref>他起初建议命名此歌为 《Becoming Popular》 或 《Popularity Song》。不过在前150条评论中获得赞同最多的名字为《The Pony Everypony Should Know》。于是丹尼尔稍后将本曲命名为“'''Becoming Popular (The Pony Everypony Should Know)'''”。<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/dannyimusic/posts/270757059638540|title=Daniel Ingram naming the Becoming Popular song|date=2011-12-03|accessdate=2011-12-03}}</ref>

:'''[Rarity]'''
::I'll be the toast of the town, the girl on the go
::I'm the type of pony every pony, every pony should know
::I'll be the one to watch, the girl in the flow
::I'm the type of pony every pony, every pony should know

::Becoming as popular as popular can be
::Making my mark, making my mark in high society
::I'm the belle of the ball, the star of the show, yeah
::I'm the type of pony every pony, every pony should know

::See how they hang on every word that I speak
::My approving glance is what they all seek
::I'm the creme de la creme, not just another Jane Doe
::I'm the type of pony every pony should know

::At home, at the opera, on a fancy yacht
::Becoming the talk, the talk of all of Canterlot
::I'm the creme de la creme, not just another Jane Doe, yeah
::I'm the type of pony every pony, every pony should know

::Because I'm the type of pony
::Yes, I'm the type of pony
::Yes, I'm the type of pony every pony should know<section end="song"></section>


==获奖与提名==
在 [[Wikipedia:39th Daytime Emmy Awards|第39届日间艾美奖]]颁奖期间，《Becoming Popular》与歌曲[[Find a Pet Song|《Find a Pet》]]一起获最佳原创儿童动画歌曲奖（Outstanding Original Song - Children's and Animation）提名。<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmyonline.org/mediacenter/daytime_39th_nominations.html|title=Nominations announced for the 39th annual Daytime Emmy Awards|work=The National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences|date=2012-05-09|accessdate=2012-05-09}}</ref>这首歌原本以《Every Pony》的名字出现在列表中，而作曲家丹尼尔·英格拉姆被记为作词者。那天内这个错误就被更正了，歌曲的标题被改回《Becoming Popular (The Pony Every Pony Should Know)》，并且加上了梅根·麦卡锡的名字，因为这首歌的大部分歌词是由她写的。
