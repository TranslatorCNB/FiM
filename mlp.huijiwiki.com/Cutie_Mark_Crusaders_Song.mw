'''《Cutie Mark Crusaders Song》'''，又名'''《The Cutie Mark Crusaders Anthem》'''，<ref>{{cite web|url=http://youtu.be/kJojJrD9oBY|title=MLP: Friendship is Magic - "The Cutie Mark Crusaders Anthem"|work=YouTube|author=Hasbro|date=2015-03-04|accessdate=2015-03-05}}</ref>是出现于剧集“[[搅局行家]]”中的一首歌曲。本曲由[[可爱标记童子军]]在小马镇学校的一场特长秀上演奏。

==制作==
Daniel Ingram describes the song's style on his website as "Cheesy 80's with 3 out of tune soloists". The song's melody is a quasi-perfect amalgam of the 80's hits [[Wikipedia:(I Just) Died in Your Arms|(I Just) Died in Your Arms]] and [[Wikipedia:Holding Out For A Hero|Holding Out For A Hero]], with an opening piano riff very reminiscent of the beginning of [[Wikipedia:Don't Stop Believin'|Don't Stop Believin']] or [[Wikipedia:Alone (Heart song)|Alone]].

After being used on [[My Little Pony Friendship is Magic|the show]], the instrumental of the song was used in Olaf in Love, the twenty-third episode of the first season of ''[[Wikipedia:Pound Puppies (2010 TV series)|Pound Puppies]]'', another show for which 丹尼尔·英格拉姆 provides music. The song is also briefly used in ''[[My Little Pony Equestria Girls]]'', as part of a music video that the human Cutie Mark Crusaders uploaded to a YouTube-like website. [[Discord]] briefly sings the song's second verse in {{comic|f2}}. The outfits worn by the CMC in this song are also worn by their human counterparts in ''[[My Little Pony Equestria Girls: Rainbow Rocks]]''.

<section begin="song" />
:'''[Scootaloo]'''
::Look, here, are three little ponies,
::Ready to sing for this crowd,
::Listen up, 'cause here's our story
::I'm gonna sing it

:'''[Cutie Mark Crusaders]'''
::Very loud!

:'''[Scootaloo]'''
::When you're a younger pony
::And your flank is very bare
::Feels like the sun will never come
::When your cutie mark's not there

::So the three of us will fight the fight
::There is nothing that we fear
::We'll have to figure out what we'll do next

:'''[Cutie Mark Crusaders]'''
::'Til our cutie marks are here!

::We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders
::On a quest to find out who we are
::And we will never stop the journey
::Not until we have our cutie marks

:'''[Scootaloo]'''
::They all say that you'll get your mark
::When the time is really right
::And you know just what you're supposed to do
::And your talent comes to light

::But it's not as easy as it sounds
::And that waiting's hard to do
::So we test our talents everywhere

:'''[Cutie Mark Crusaders]'''
::Until our face is blue

::We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders
::On a quest to find out who we are
::And we will never stop the journey
::Not until we have our cutie marks

::We are the Cutie Mark Crusaders
::On a quest to find out who we are
::And we will never stop the journey
::Not until we have our cutie marks!<section end="song" />
