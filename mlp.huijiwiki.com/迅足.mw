'''Fleetfoot''' is a female [[Pegasi|Pegasus]] [[Ponies|pony]] and a member of the aerial acrobatics group, the [[Wonderbolts]]. She first appears in [[The Best Night Ever]], and she is first mentioned by name in [[Sweet and Elite]].

==发展==
The name "Fleetfoot" was previously used for a male G1 character. This Fleetfoot is the leader of a race of ostrich-like creatures called the Sqree.

==剧中描述==
Fleetfoot first appears very briefly at a table in the VIP section of the [[Grand Galloping Gala]] in [[The Best Night Ever]], though she has no lines and is never identified. She appears again in [[Sweet and Elite]], where [[Rarity]] refers to her by name and she comes in first place at the Wonderbolts Derby.

[[File:The Wonderbolts prepare to race S2E09.png|thumb|left|Fleetfoot at the Wonderbolts Derby in Sweet and Elite.]] Fleetfoot appears again in [[Rainbow Falls]] as a member of the [[Cloudsdale]] Aerial Relay team with [[Spitfire]] and [[Soarin]]; the three compete to qualify for the [[Equestria Games (event)|Equestria Games]]. After Soarin injures his wing during practice, Fleetfoot conspires with Spitfire to recruit [[Rainbow Dash]] to their team and replace him. They initially invite her to practice with them until Soarin recovers, but they later ask her to join the team permanently. When Rainbow Dash finds out the truth, confronts them, and chooses to continue competing for [[Ponyville]], Fleetfoot commends Rainbow Dash for her loyalty, having learned a valuable lesson from her competitor. The episode also reveals that Fleetfoot speaks with a slight [[wikipedia:Lisp|lisp]].

In [[Equestria Games]], Fleetfoot and her team appear at the Games, competing in the horse-shoe event against the other teams and wins first prize. Fleetfoot also witnesses [[Spike]] singing the [[Songs#Other musical elements|Cloudsdale Anthem]] wrong, and gets embarrassed because of it. Fleetfoot is also one of the [[Pegasi]] to attempt to save the crowd against an icy cloud [[Dr. Hooves|one]] of the archer ponies accidentally causes.

In [[Twilight's Kingdom - Part 1]], Fleetfoot appears alongside other [[Wonderbolts]] and academy cadets attempting to stop [[Lord Tirek]], but she ends up having her Pegasus magic stolen. Her magic is returned to her at the end of [[Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2]]. She later sees the rainbow with Spitfire and Soarin during the song [[Let the Rainbow Remind You]].

Fleetfoot appears in [[Rarity Investigates!]] alongside the other Wonderbolts, and escorts newly discharged Wonderbolt [[Wind Rider]] out of the room before performing in the show.

In [[Newbie Dash]], Fleetfoot appears as one of the central performing Wonderbolts. After Rainbow Dash fails to impress the team and earns a humiliating nickname, Fleetfoot explains how she earned the nickname "Flatfoot" on her first day as a Wonderbolt. Fleetfoot's photo appears in the classroom in [[Top Bolt]].

Fleetfoot appears in [[Parental Glideance]] both in the present day and in flashback as a filly.

==《My Little Pony The Movie》中的描述==
Fleetfoot appears with the rest of the Wonderbolts during the Friendship Festival in ''[[My Little Pony The Movie]]''.

==漫画中的描述==
[[File:Comic issue 9 Comics World cover.jpg|thumb|Fleetfoot fantasizing about Big McIntosh.]] In the [[IDW comics]], Fleetfoot appears in ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic (comics)|Friendship is Magic]]'' [[Zen and the Art of Gazebo Repair|Issues #9-10]], ''[[My Little Pony Micro-Series|Micro-Series]]'' [[Micro-Series Issue 10|Issue #10]], and ''[[My Little Pony: Friends Forever|Friends Forever]]'' [[Friends Forever Issue 9|Issue #9]]. Both her eye color and, in a fantasy, cutie mark are shown to be different in the comics than they would be in the show, due to the aforementioned issues being released prior to the premiere of [[Rainbow Falls]].

In the ''Friendship is Magic'' issues, Fleetfoot gets knocked out of the sky by the [[Cutie Mark Crusaders]]' fireworks at [[Ponyville]]'s Summer Wrap-Up Festival and Hoedown, crashes into [[Big McIntosh]], and instantly falls in love with him. She fantasizes about a life married to him, but her fantasy is the result of a concussion she suffers from the crash. Sometime after being carted off by medical ponies, Fleetfoot stalks Big McIntosh throughout the story, mistaking trinkets he hands off to her as gifts. When [[Tealove]] also shows interest in Big McIntosh, Fleetfoot gets into a catfight with her. In the ''Micro-Series'' issue, Fleetfoot receives an award "for defending Ponyville from rampant fireworks."

In {{comic|32}}, Fleetfoot appears on page 10 with yellow eyes. In {{comic|41}}, Fleetfoot appears, with pink eyes, with Spitfire on pages 12 and 17.

A human counterpart of Fleetfoot appears as a [[Canterlot High School|Canterlot High]] student and soccer team member in IDW Publishing's ''[[My Little Pony Annual 2013]]''.
