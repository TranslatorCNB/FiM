'''Shake Your Tail''' is a [[songs|song]] featured in the ''[[My Little Pony Equestria Girls: Rainbow Rocks]]'' [[My Little Pony Equestria Girls: Rainbow Rocks/Animated shorts|animated short]] of the same name, as well as being the fifth of eleven songs featured in ''[[My Little Pony Equestria Girls: Rainbow Rocks]]''. It is performed by [[the Rainbooms]]. During the Rainbooms' performance of the song, [[Photo Finish]], the Snapshots, and [[Snips and Snails (EG)|Snips and Snails]] attempt to sabotage the performance by doing things like holding magnets to all the steel trimmings on Rarity's dress or putting the spotlight over the stage-frightened Fluttershy.

The short is one of the first eight released as a tie-in to the ''Rainbow Rocks'' film. It is the first to be published by the German ''Equestria Girls'' YouTube channel, in English on April 16, 2014<ref name="April 16">,{{cite web|url=https://plus.google.com/110231057765537634447/posts/HT6jiyvHsEh|title=Equestria Girls|publisher=Google+|date=2014-04-16|accessdate=2014-04-18}}</ref> until the upload was made unavailable later in the same week due to a copyright claim by Hasbro Studios LLC, the seventh to be published by the Hasbro Studios Shorts YouTube channel, in English on June 6, 2014, the sixth to be published by the ''My Little Pony'' Facebook page, in English on June 17, 2014,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=889792497704855|title=My Little Pony|publisher=Facebook|date=2014-06-17|accessdate=2014-06-18}}</ref> and the fourth to be published overall.

==制作==
The song was first revealed in a ''Rainbow Rocks'' clip released via Entertainment Weekly,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://family-room.ew.com/2014/02/13/my-little-pony-equestria-girls-rainbow-rocks/|title='My Little Pony Equestria Girls': Yes, there will be a sequel. And we've got a clip! EXCLUSIVE|author=Hillary Busis|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=2014-02-13|accessdate=2014-02-13}}</ref> and more of the song first appeared as a different version in chapters 6, 16, and 17 and the bonus activity page "Lyrical Laughter" of the ''[[Chapter books#Equestria Girls: Rainbow Rocks|My Little Pony: Equestria Girls: Rainbow Rocks]]'' screenplay novelization of the animated shorts.

The short was adapted into chapters 16 and 17 of the ''Rainbow Rocks'' novelization, which was released more than a week earlier than the short itself. According to the book, as is for the short [[Perfect Day for Fun]], Twilight's presence in this short is just a figment of her own imagination, because she misses her friends from Canterlot High, so she imagines to be there with them.

An instrumental version is heard in Hasbro's online game Rainbooms Repeat the Beat, the Hasbro Arcade minigame ''My Little Pony Equestria Girls: Rainbow Rocks'', and the [[DJ Pon-3]] minigame from the ''Equestria Girls'' app.

The song serves as the fifth track on the [[My Little Pony Equestria Girls: Rainbow Rocks - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]. The version on the album is slightly different as the first pre-chorus contains a [[Wikipedia:Hammond organ|Hammond organ]] solo. It is also the first track on [[My Little Pony Equestria Girls - Rainbow Rocks CD]].

As revealed in the commentary, the film sequence was storyboarded by Carrie Mombourquette, the same artist who boarded the short version.

==动画短片剧情简介==
The short is a music video wherein the six friends perform the song at a school dance party. The performance is interspersed with a story in which the six attempt to decorate the school auditorium for the party. Each tries out a different theme for the party that ends in failure of some sort: [[Pinkie Pie (EG)|Pinkie Pie]]'s luau-themed set that falls apart around her; [[Rainbow Dash (EG)|Rainbow Dash]] bombards her friends with soccer balls and basketballs in a sports theme; [[Applejack (EG)|Applejack]]'s country theme includes a dangerous rodeo bull; [[Rarity (EG)|Rarity]]'s elegant masquerade falls through when Pinkie startles everyone with a tiki mask; [[Twilight Sparkle]] turns the party into a boring study session; and [[Fluttershy (EG)|Fluttershy]]'s petting zoo idea results in animals running amok. Finally, Rainbow Dash comes up with an idea and combines all of their themes into one.
