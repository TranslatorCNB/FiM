==歌词==
:'''[Pinkie Pie]'''
::This is your singing telegram
::I hope it finds you well
::You're invited to a party
::'Cause we think you're really swell

::Gummy's turning one year old
::So help us celebrate
::The cake will be delicious
::The festivities first-rate

::There will be games and dancing
::Bob for apples, cut a rug [pop]
::And when the party's over
::We'll gather 'round for a group hug

::[Slowing down]
::No need to bring a gift
::Being there will be enough
::Birthdays mean having fun with friends
::Not getting lots of stuff

::[Breathing heavily]
::It won't be the same without you
::So we hope that you say yes
::So, please, oh please R.S.V.P.
::And come, and be our guest!
