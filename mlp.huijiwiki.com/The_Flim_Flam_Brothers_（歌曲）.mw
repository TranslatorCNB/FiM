From when the song begins, the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000's mechanical sounds match the beat of the music, which was accomplished by the sound design team providing Daniel Ingram and Steffan Andrews with samples of the sound effects of the cider machine, which they then implemented into the song's composition.

The number shares many similarities to the number "Ya Got Trouble" from ''[[Wikipedia:The Music Man|The Music Man]]''. Both songs share the same fast-talking vocal style, and both are sung by people wearing [[wikipedia:Boater|straw boater hats]] who are addressing the inhabitants of a small town. In both songs, the lyrics take the form of a speech which the singer uses to convince the townsfolk into falling for his scheme. By the end of both songs, the crowd is so fully convinced that it joins in to sing the final chorus, with particular emphasis on the chanting of one key word: "trouble" in the original and "cider" in this song.

本曲的器乐片段被用于Hub Network网站上的 [http://www.hubnetwork.com/shows/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic/games/pinkie-pies-party-cannon-blast Pinkie Pie's Cannon Blast!] 游戏中。

本曲是原声专辑《[[Songs of Friendship and Magic]]》的第六首歌曲，在专辑中其名字为《'''The Flim Flam Cider Song'''》；此外，它还是黑胶原声专辑《[[Magical Friendship Tour]]》A面的第三首歌曲。

<section begin="song" />
:'''[Flim]'''
::Well, lookie what we got here, brother of mine, it's the same in every town
::Ponies with thirsty throats, dry tongues, and not a drop of cider to be found
::Maybe they're not aware that there's really no need for this teary despair

:'''[Flam]'''
::That the key that they need to solve this sad cider shortage you and I will share

:'''Ponies''': [excited chattering]

:'''[Flam]'''
::I say, our mode of locomotion

:'''[Flim]'''
::And I suppose by now you're wondering, where is this promised cider?

:'''[Flam]'''
::Any horse can make a claim and any pony can do the same

::Unseen at any time in this big new world

::The fun begins!

:'''Flim''': Now, here's where the magic happens. Right here in this heaving, roiling, cider-press-boiling guts of the very machine, those apples plucked fresh are right now as we speak being turned into grade-A, top-notch, five-star, blow-your-horseshoes-off, one-of-a-kind cider!

:'''[Flam]'''
::Feel free to take a sneak peek!

:'''[Granny Smith]'''
::Now wait, you fellers, hold it!
::You went and over-sold it!
::I guarantee that what you have there won't compare
::For the very most important ingredient
::Can't be added or done expedient
::And it's quality, friends, Apple Acres' quality and care!

:'''[Flim]'''
::Well, Granny, I'm glad you brought that up, my dear, I say I'm glad you brought that up
::You see that we are very picky when it comes to cider if you'll kindly try a cup

:'''[Flam]'''
::Yes, sir, yes, ma'am, this great machine lets just the very best
:: So whaddaya say then, Apples?
:: Care to step into the modern world
::And put the Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000 to the test?

:'''[Crowd]'''
::Cider, cider, cider, cider... [continues until Flim and Flam begin singing]

:'''Flim''': What do you think, folks? Do you see what the Apples can't? I see it clear as day! I know she does! So does he! C'mon, Ponyville, you know what I'm talking about!

:'''[Flim and Flam]'''
::We're saying you've got

:'''[Flim, Flam, and Crowd]'''
