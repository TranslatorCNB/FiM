<section begin="song" />
:'''[The Rainbooms]'''
::We're all different
::But our music is the same
::It's the sound of friendship
::It's in the rhythm of our names

::Fluttershy listens and never drops a beat
::Pinkie's Pie's tempo keeps you tapping your feet

::Rarity's playing keeps us all in tune
::And Sunset's vocals shimmer over the moon

::Applejack's notes make you want to sing
::And, Rainbow Dash, she riffs on everything!<section end="song"></section>
