<section begin="song" />
:'''[Rarity]'''
::Thread by thread, stitching it together
::Twilight's dress, cutting out the pattern snip by snip
::Making sure the fabric folds nicely
::It's the perfect color and ''so'' hip
::Always gotta keep in mind my pacing
::Making sure the clothes' correctly facing
::I'm stitching Twilight's dress

::Yard by yard, fussing on the details
::Jewel neckline, don't you know a stitch in time saves nine?
::Make her something perfect to inspire
::Even though she hates formal attire
::Gotta mind those intimate details
::Even though she's more concerned with sales
::It's Applejack's new dress

::Dressmaking's easy, for Pinkie Pie something pink
::Fluttershy something breezy
::Blend color and form,
::''[To Opalescence]'' Do you think it looks cheesy?

::Something brash, perhaps quite fetching
::Hook and eye, couldn't you just simply die?
::Making sure it fits forelock and crest
::Don't forget some magic in the dress
::Even though it rides high on the flank
::Rainbow won't look like a tank
::I'm stitching Rainbow's dress

::Piece by piece, snip by snip
::Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip
::Thread by thread, primmed and pressed
::Yard by yard, never stressed
::And that's the art of the dress!<section end="song"></section>

<section begin="song1" />
:'''Twilight Sparkle''': Now, the stars on my belt need to be technically accurate. Orion has three stars on his belt, not four.

:'''[Rarity]'''
::Stitch by stitch, stitching it together
::Deadline looms, don't you know the client's always right?
::Even if my fabric choice was perfect
::Gotta get them all done by tonight
::Pinkie Pie, that color's too obtrusive
::Wait until you see it in the light
::I'm sewing them together!

:'''Pinkie Pie''': Don't you think my gown would be more "''me''" with some lollipops?
:'''Rarity''': Well, I think...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Balloons?
:'''Rarity''': Well...
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Do it!

:'''[Rarity]'''
::Hour by hour, one more change
::I'm sewing them together, take great pains
::Fluttershy, you're putting me in a bind
::Rainbow Dash, what is on your mind?
::Oh my gosh, there's simply not much time
::Don't forget, Applejack's duds must shine

::Dressmaking's easy, every customer's call
::Brings a whole new revision
::Have to pick up the pace, still hold to my vision

:'''Twilight Sparkle''': That constellation is Canis Major, not Minor.
:'''Fluttershy''': French haute couture, please.
:'''Rarity''': Ugh...

:'''Applejack''': What if it rains? Galoshes!

:'''Pinkie Pie''': More balloons! Oh no, that's too many balloons. More candy! Oh, less candy. Oh wait, I know. Streamers!
:'''Rarity''': Streamers?
:'''Pinkie Pie''': Whose dress is this?
:'''Rarity''': Streamers it is.

:'''Rainbow Dash''': What?
:'''Rarity''': Aren't you going to tell me to change something too?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': No, I just want my dress to be cool.
:'''Rarity''': Do you not like the color?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': The color's fine, just make it look cooler.
:'''Rarity''': Do you not like the shape?
:'''Rainbow Dash''': The shape's fine, just make the whole thing... you know, cooler. It needs to be about 20% cooler.

:'''[Pinkie Pie]'''
::All we ever want is indecision
:'''[Rainbow Dash]'''
::All we really like is what we know
:'''[Twilight Sparkle]'''
::Gotta balance style with adherence
:'''[Fluttershy]'''
::Making sure we make a good appearance
:'''[Applejack]'''
::Even if you simply have to fudge it
:'''[All sans Rarity]'''
::Make sure that it stays within our budget

:'''[Rarity]'''
::Got to overcome intimidation
::Remember, it's all in the presentation!

::Piece by piece, snip by snip
::Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip
::Bolt by bolt, primmed and pressed
::Yard by yard, always stressed
::And that's the art of the dress!<section end="song1"></section>
