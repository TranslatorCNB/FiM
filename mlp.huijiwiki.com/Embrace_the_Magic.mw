:'''[Sunset Shimmer]'''
::So you have magic
::And it's not that great
::But when it found you
::You know it was fate

::And it might seem scary now
::But it can be wonderful, too
::So how about we embrace the magic
::And make the magic part of you?

::You take a little dash of magic
::And you let it ignite
::Mix things up a little bit
::And it might start to go right

::In just five seconds flat
::How the story has changed
::All 'cause now you've embraced the magic
::And it just got better in every way

::I say embrace the magic
::No more holding back, just let it out
::If you can take the magic
::And learn a little more what it can do
::Once the magic is part of you

::What's standing in your way
::That you can't move today?
::You've got the strength in you
::To make your dreams come true

::No need to shield yourself
::From the magic that can help
::Protect from any harm that might come

::So you have magic
::And it's not that great
::But when it found you
::You know it was fate

::So if you listen close
::You might make a new friend
::And together we can make it!

::I say embrace the magic
::No more holding back, just let it out
::If you can take the magic
::And learn a little more what it can do
::Once the magic is part of you
::Once the magic is part of you
::Once the magic is part of you

::Once the magic is part of you<section end="song"></section>

::So you have magic, and it's not that great.
::But when it found you, it was fate.
::It's scary but it's wonderful, too.
::Just keep at it, and you'll agree.
::Embrace the magic, then you'll see.
::It's better once you know it's part of you.

::Oh, to have your energy!
::How amazing life would be!
::You can turn the everyday into a blast.

::Super speed, it's so much fun.
::In five seconds, you'll get it done.
::You really know what it means to be fast.

::If you embrace the magic,
::There is so much you can do.
::If you just embrace the magic,
::You'll find a better you.

::Super strength, what's there to say?
::There's nothing standing in your way.
::Moving things with ease? It must be swell!

::Crystal shield, it's more than bling.
::Protect your friends from anything.
::Even if that something is themselves!

::Animals, they're mysteries.
::To talk to them is quite a feat.
::I'm sure they have interestings to say.

::As for me, I've got the touch.
::Close to someone, I can learn so much.
::It's a power I hope never goes away.

::If you just embrace the magic,
::There is so much you can do!﻿<section end="booksong"></section>
