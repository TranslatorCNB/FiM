==[[The Return of Harmony Part 1]]==
*[[Discord]] is inspired by [[John de Lancie]]'s popular character [[Wikipedia:Q (Star Trek)|Q]] from the second ''[[Wikipedia:Star Trek|Star Trek]]'' television series, ''[[wikipedia:Star Trek: The Next Generation|Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. After the part was written, de Lancie was contacted to provide the voicework for Discord.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equestriadaily.com/2011/09/massive-jayson-thiessen-q-from-bronycon.html |title=Massive Jayson Thiessen Q&A From Bronycon | date=2011-09-24 |accessdate=2012-12-30}}</ref> Q and Discord share a fondness for cruel games, amusing themselves at the expense of others, occasional use of rhymes, finger snapping to use their powers, and a white flash accompanied by a similar chime-like sound effect signifying the use of their powers.
*Pinkie Pie refers to the "chocolate rain" caused by Discord, a choice of words that evokes the title of a popular YouTube music video named [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwTZ2xpQwpA "Chocolate Rain"] by Tay Zonday. On September 26, 2013, Zonday himself released his [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKFpYX9cp-k&sns=tw cover of the MLP:FIM theme song].
*The rabbits that are transformed by Discord grow long bony needle-like legs, similar to creatures found in paintings by the surrealist painter [[Wikipedia:Salvador Dalí|Salvador Dalí]], for example ''The Temptation of Saint Anthony'', ''The Elephants'', and ''Dream Caused by the Flight of a Bee Around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening''.

==[[Luna Eclipsed]]==
*The episode title is a pun on [[Wikipedia:Lunar eclipse|lunar eclipse]].

*The Paleopony Period is a reference to the [[Wikipedia:Paleolithic|Paleolithic Age]] of human prehistory, a large part of the Stone Age.
*Applejack asks Zecora, "Was your zebra sense a-tinglin'?", which is a reference to [[Wikipedia:Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]'s ESP super-power, ''Spider-sense'', which he often mentions with the famous line "My spider-sense is tingling!".
*The statue Apple Bloom carves is a ponified version of [[Wikipedia:Venus Anadyomene|Venus Anadyomene]], a common figure in art in antiquity and the Renaissance.

==[[May the Best Pet Win!]]==
*The episode is an allusion to the famous Aesop fable "[[Wikipedia:The Tortoise and the Hare|The Tortoise and the Hare]]".
*Fluttershy and Rainbow Dash's [[Find A Pet Song]] was inspired by the song "Fabulous Places" from ''[[Wikipedia:Doctor Dolittle|Doctor Dolittle]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/dannyimusic/posts/263344313713148?comment_id=3327527&offset=200&total_comments=613|title=Daniel Ingram discussing the "Find A Pet Song"|accessdate=2013-05-04|date=2011-11-20}}</ref>

==[[The Mysterious Mare Do Well]]==
*The episode's lead storyboard artist, [[Sabrina Alberghetti]], commented on how the crew incorporated "one [superhero] cliché after another" in a "fun tongue-in-cheek kind of way."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comments.deviantart.com/4/1453017/2298601959|title=Alberghetti comments on the The Mysterious Mare Do Well's "&#91;superhero&#93; clichés" on her deviantArt page|accessdate=2011-12-01|date=}}</ref> Among them:
**Rainbow Dash's catchphrase, "Never fear, your friendly neighborhood Rainbow Dash is here!" is a play on both "your friendly neighborhood [[Wikipedia:Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]" and "There’s no need to fear, [[Wikipedia:Underdog (TV series)|Underdog]] is here!"
**The Mysterious Mare Do Well shares the same purple-and-black color scheme and wide-brim hat and black ribbon as [[Wikipedia:Darkwing Duck|Darkwing Duck]].

**Pinkie Pie's use throughout the episode of the Pinkie Sense, which enables her to detect potential danger, parodies Spider-Man's own ESP super-power, the Spider-Sense.
**The fanfare, accompanying music, and [[:File:Mysterious Mare Do Well rally posters Batman S2E08.png|rally posters]] of the Mare Do Well strongly resemble the same from ''[[Wikipedia:Batman: The Animated Series|Batman: The Animated Series]]''.
*The musical score as the cart rolls uncontrollably downhill mimics the score of the 1994 film ''[[Wikipedia:Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]''.
*Part of the scene where Rainbow Dash is chasing after Mare Do Well has Mare Do Well running by in the foreground, Rainbow rushing where she saw her, Mare Do Well running by in the background, Rainbow running over there, Mare Do Well running by in the foreground, and so on. This is similar to a scene from the [[Wikipedia: Looney Tunes|Looney Tunes]] cartoon ''[[Wikipedia: What's Opera, Doc?|What's Opera, Doc?]]'', when Elmer Fudd chases a disguised Bugs Bunny.
*The name "Mare Do Well" is an ironic reference to the term "ne'er-do-well", a person who does no good.

==[[Sweet and Elite]]==
*Among other places Rarity visits in the montage is an art exhibit, where the central painting on the wall combines elements of [[Wikipedia:Salvador Dalí|Salvador Dalí]]'s paintings, particularly [[Wikipedia:The Persistence of Memory|The Persistence of Memory]]. The painting to the left resembles [[Wikipedia:Pablo Picasso|Pablo Picasso]]'s signature style of [[Wikipedia:Cubism|Cubism]]. The painting to the right is an abstract style akin to the works of [[Wikipedia:Wassily Kandinsky|Wassily Kandinsky]]. The show's director, [[Jayson Thiessen]], had hinted about avant-garde art in [[:File:Jayson Thiessen interview Equestria Daily 2011-09-14.pdf|an interview]] in September 2011, long before the episode's initial broadcast.
*When Rarity examines the art exhibit she is dressed in stereotypical [[Wikipedia:Beatnik|Beatnik]] fashion: a scarlet beret with a black turtleneck and black slippers, and mane let down with bangs hanging straight across her forehead.
*One of the bags holding Rarity's purchases in the scene where she runs into Fancy Pants has two horseshoes arranged to imitate the [[Wikipedia:Chanel|Chanel]] fashion house logo.
*The music played when Rarity washes Opal in order to make her look sick for Fluttershy and the others is an adaptation of [[Wikipedia:Maurice Ravel|Maurice Ravel]]'s "Bolero", which was famously performed by ice-skaters Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean at the 1984 Winter Olympics.{{specify}}

*One of the working titles of the episode, "Attack of the 50 Foot Dragon", is a play on the movie title ''[[Wikipedia:Attack of the 50 Foot Woman|Attack of the 50 Foot Woman]]'', and it hints to the episode's "giant monster rampaging through a city" theme that was popularized by the 1954 film ''[[Wikipedia:Godzilla (1954)|Godzilla]]''.
*The scene in which Spike wears the white hat and carries the ball is an allusion to [[Wikipedia:The Godfather Part II|The Godfather Part II]], when [[Wikipedia:Don Fanucci|Don Fanucci]] walks along the street also wearing a white hat and with an orange in his hand.

*In the bakery scene, Pinkie Pie throws cakes at Spike features music extremely reminiscent of music found in ''Aliens''.{{specify}}
*The line "Twilight, get my rope" was inspired by a 1980s Pace sauce commercial.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/m_a_larson/status/206947742742884352|title=M. A. Larson discussing the line "Twilight, get my rope."|date=2012-05-27|accessdate=2012-07-28}}</ref>

*Scootaloo getting her tongue stuck to a frozen giant candy cane is a reference to a scene from the 1983 film ''[[wikipedia:A Christmas Story|A Christmas Story]]''.
*The ponies in the past sequences sport a mixture of medieval and renaissance clothing, with ethnic German garb and Roman legionnaire armor (similar to that of the present day Equestrian Royal Guards) for the Earth Ponies and Pegasi, respectively; Spike also dons Renaissance garb as he narrates on stage.
*Some of the music that plays towards the end is based on the English folk song "[[Wikipedia:Greensleeves|Greensleeves]]".
*Pinkie Pie's quote, "...I am just about to be brilliant," mirrors one of [[Wikipedia:Donald O'Connor|Donald O'Connor]]'s lines in ''[[Wikipedia:Singin' in the Rain|Singin' in the Rain]]''. He sings the song "[[Wikipedia:Make 'Em Laugh|Make 'Em Laugh]]" in the film.
*The [[Creatures#Windigo|windigos]] in the play share their name and some characteristics with the Wendigo from myths in Algonquin-speaking tribes. They are strongly related to winter and starvation.

==[[Family Appreciation Day]]==
*The Cutie Mark Crusaders manipulating a sleeping Granny Smith with a series of ropes to make it appear as if she was awake and speaking is similar to a scene in the 1989 film ''[[Wikipedia:Weekend at Bernie's|Weekend at Bernie's]]''.

*Pinkie's "spot remover" joke is a staple of [[wikipedia:Steven Wright|Steven Wright]]'s stand-up routine.
*During Pinkie Pie's [[Piggy Dance]], she uses her tail as a spring while she's balancing, similarly to [[w:c:disney:Tigger|Tigger]] from Winnie the Pooh.
*[[Pound Cake and Pumpkin Cake]]'s mannerisms mirror those of Bam Bam and Pebbles, respectively, from ''[[Wikipedia:The Flintstones|The Flintstones]]''.
*The screeching violins that play when Pinkie Pie finds [[Pound Cake]] on the ceiling echo the musical piece ''[[Wikipedia:The Murder|The Murder]]'', made famous by the film ''[[Wikipedia:Psycho (film)|Psycho]]''.
*The scene where Pound Cake crawls along the ceiling is a reference to the film ''[[wikipedia:Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]''.
*The music that plays when Pinkie Pie urges the Cakes to pick her as babysitter is based on ''[[Wikipedia:Aquarela do Brasil|Aquarela do Brasil]]'', a Brazilian samba standard from the 1930s.
*Pinkie's instructions for using the crib echoes a line from ''[[Wikipedia:The Simpsons|The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Wikipedia:The Last Temptation of Homer|The Last Temptation of Homer]]": "Napping, sleeping, and on occasion with permission, as a pretend old-timey western fort" and "Sleeping, eating, and maybe building a little fort."

==[[The Last Roundup]]==
*The music used in the beginning of the episode where [[Applejack]] is running an obstacle course is similar to the NBC western series ''[[Wikipedia:Bonanza|Bonanza]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s opening theme.
*Dodge Junction is a namesake of [[Wikipedia:Dodge City|Dodge City]], a famous locale for western films and the western series ''[[Wikipedia:Gunsmoke|Gunsmoke]]''.

*The scene where Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy work at a conveyor belt and can't handle the pace is a homage to the television series ''[[Wikipedia:I Love Lucy|I Love Lucy]]''. The scene replicates one from the ''I Love Lucy'' episode "Job Switching", (which, in turn, was inspired by a scene from the [[wikipedia:Charlie Chaplin|Charlie Chaplin]] film ''[[wikipedia:Modern Times (film)|Modern Times]]'') where Lucy and Ethel wear mushroom-like hats and work on a production line wrapping candies. They can't handle the pace, so they stuff the chocolates into their hats and mouths.

==[[The Super Speedy Cider Squeezy 6000]]==
*The musical number [[The Flim Flam Brothers]] shares many similarities with the number "[[Wikipedia:Ya Got Trouble|Ya Got Trouble]]" from ''[[Wikipedia:The Music Man|The Music Man]]'', specifically the identical rhyming styles, staccatos, and theme of smooth-talking conmen trying to win over a small town. Mid-song, the ponies chant "cider, cider, cider!" in the same manner that the people of River City chant "trouble, trouble, trouble!" in the ''Music Man'' number. The Brothers' style of dress and performance is also a nod to [[Wikipedia:Vaudeville|Vaudeville]].
*The competition between the Apple family and the machine alludes to the legend of John Henry and the Steam Drill, albeit with less fatal results.
*Granny Smith refuses to have a competition with the Flim Flam Brothers until one of them says, "What's the matter, Granny? Chicken?" At this point Granny Smith begins to scream at him and insist upon the competition. Later, Apple Bloom points out that "nopony calls Granny a chicken." This sequence is a reference to the film ''[[Wikipedia:Back to the Future Part II|Back to the Future Part II]]''.

==[[欲罢不能]]==
*The musical cue that plays when Rainbow Dash looks at the book and starts reading is very similar to the one that plays in a similar scene in the film ''[[Wikipedia:The NeverEnding Story (film)|The NeverEnding Story]]''.
*The quote of Pinkie Pie saying "Did the crash somehow give her super-duper spider powers?" and the doctor saying "No, nor did it give her amazing healing powers" allude to the powers of Marvel comic-book characters [[Wikipedia:Spider-Man|Spider-Man]] and [[Wikipedia:Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] respectively. Pinkie Pie's quote also alludes to the common comic book cliche of gaining super-powers by means of a random accident.
* The scene of Rainbow Dash in her hospital room bouncing a ball off the wall is lifted straight from the World War 2 film, ''[[wikipedia:The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]''.
*The game that Fluttershy and Twilight Sparkle play with Rainbow Dash is very similar to ''[[Wikipedia:Battleship (game)|Battleship]]'', which is produced by [[Wikipedia:Milton Bradley Company|Milton Bradley]] and owned by [[Wikipedia:Hasbro|Hasbro]].

*There are several allusions to the ''[[Wikipedia:Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' franchise, primarily to ''[[Wikipedia:Raiders of the Lost Ark|Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'':
**The ''pizzicato'' (plucking the strings) that plays when Daring Do first enters the temple is similar to the music that plays early in the film, when Indiana Jones and his partner have spiders on their backs.
**The sunlight shining into the chamber parallels the Indiana Jones map room scene where the sunlight shines on a crystal in the center of the room.
**The way Daring Do makes her way to the Sapphire Stone's pedestal mirrors a scene in [[Wikipedia:The Last Crusade|The Last Crusade]] where Indiana Jones navigates a trapped floor by stepping on the tiles marked with the correct answer to a puzzle.

==[[Hearts and Hooves Day]]==
*The line "We're gonna need a bigger envelope" is a parody of the "You're gonna need a bigger boat" line from ''[[wikipedia:Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''.

*The ''Smile'' Song, especially the ending part is a slight parody of, and possibly an inspiration to, a song in ''Joseph''.
*"[[You're a Cranky Doodle Donkey|Cranky Doodle Donkey]]" has the same meter as ''[[Wikipedia:Yankee Doodle|Yankee Doodle Dandy]]'', a pejorative song sung by the British to mock the American revolutionaries. Cranky's leitmotif is a minor key variation of the song.
*The song Pinkie sings at the end of the episode is based on the version of the song from [[Wikipedia:Yankee Doodle Dandy|the film of the same name]].
*Pinkie's line "Ooh, what does this bauble do?" has the same meter as "Ooh, what does this button do?", the catchphrase of the character Dee Dee from the cartoon ''[[Wikipedia:Dexter's Laboratory|Dexter's Laboratory]]''.

==[[Putting Your Hoof Down]]==
*The title "Putting Your Hoof Down" is a play on the saying "putting your foot down."
*Fluttershy parodies the famous line from the 1939 film ''[[Wikipedia:Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' "As God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again!" with "As [[Celestia]] as my witness, I'll never be a pushover again!" much like Rarity in [[#Sisterhooves Social|Sisterhooves Social]].
*When Iron Will appears at the beginning of his assertiveness workshop, the background music borrows from the primary motif of "Eye of the Tiger" by [[Wikipedia:Survivor (band)|Survivor]] with only the last two notes changed.
*Iron Will's presentation takes place in the center of a hedge maze, a reference to the Labyrinth of Greek mythology, which held the [[Wikipedia:Minotaur|Minotaur]] at its center.
*Iron Will uses a variation of the phrase "I pity the fool", the catchphrase of [[Wikipedia:Mr. T|Mr. T]].
*The storyboard artists had professional wrestler [[Wikipedia:Hulk Hogan|Hulk Hogan]] in mind when posing Iron Will,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDcOKL-4VCI&t=44m05s|title=Everfree Radio interview with Jim Miller|date=2012-08-31|accessdate=2012-08-31}}</ref> who uses hand gestures that mimic Hogan's signature taunts.

*The episode incorporates a sound-alike of the theme "The Lonely Man" from the [[Wikipedia:CBS|CBS]] television series ''[[Wikipedia:The Incredible Hulk (TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]''.
*Pinkie Pie switches sides to win a rapid-fire argument between herself and other characters, which is the hallmark of the [[Wikipedia:Bugs Bunny|Bugs Bunny]] cartoon ''[[Wikipedia:Rabbit Fire|Rabbit Fire]]''.

==[[It's About Time]]==
*This episode borrows elements from Greek mythology:
**[[Wikipedia:Cerberus|Cerberus]] is the three-headed canine that protects the gateway to the Hades, the realm of the dead.
**[[Wikipedia:Tartarus|Tartarus]], the area that Cerberus in this episode guards, is one of the darker and deeper depths of the Underworld where the wicked are said to depart to after death.
*Future Twilight's [[:File:Future Twilight begins to teleport to the present S2E20.png|arrival]] is preceded by wind blowing paper around, then she appears in a bright flash and electrical discharge while crouched on the ground, in homage to ''[[Wikipedia:The Terminator|The Terminator]]''. Present Twilight also refers to an "epic pony war in the distant future", a crucial part of the premise of the Terminator franchise.
*The music played as Future Twilight attempts to explain why she is there to Present Twilight is similar to "I Am the Doctor" from the TV show [[Wikipedia:Doctor Who|Doctor Who]], which typically revolves heavily around time travel.
*Spike's query of "[[Wikipedia:Isn't This Where We Came In?|Isn't this where we came in?]]" while wandering the Canterlot library echos [[Wikipedia:The Wall|Pink Floyd's The Wall]] where the exact line is used to connect the end and beginning of the album into a repeating loop, similar to the time travel cause-and-effect in this episode.
*Future Twilight's [[:File:Twilight hiding S2E20.png|appearance]] and [[:File:Twilight talks with Twilight S2E20.png|attire]] is inspired by that of [[wikipedia:Snake Plissken|Snake Plissken]] from the 1981 film [[Wikipedia:Escape from New York|Escape from New York]].

==[[Dragon Quest]]==

*The episode's plot is similar to an episode from the 1980s series ''[[Wikipedia:My Little Pony (TV series)|My Little Pony]]'', "Spike's Search", where Spike goes on a quest to learn to be a dragon and gets involved with a group of dragons who turn out to be thieves and bullies.
*Fluttershy's escape out the window is a parody of the Cowardly Lion's escape from the Wizard in the 1939 film ''[[wikipedia:The Wizard of Oz (film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.
*The scene with Spike traveling down the river on a boat with Cranky Doodle Donkey bears a resemblance to Mark Twain's novel ''[[Wikipedia:Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]''.

*The game "King of the Hoard" the teenage dragons play appears to be the same as the children's game "[[Wikipedia:King of the Hill (game)|King of the Hill]]".

==[[Hurricane Fluttershy]]==

==[[MMMystery on the Friendship Express]]==
*The title of the episode references the 1934 crime novel ''[[Wikipedia:Murder on the Orient Express|Murder on the Orient Express]]'' by [[Wikipedia:Agatha Christie|Agatha Christie]], as does the outcome of the case: nearly every passenger is responsible for one part of the "crime".
*The hat Pinkie Pie wears and the bubble-blowing pipe are references to the fictional detective [[Wikipedia:Sherlock Holmes|Sherlock Holmes]]. Twilight's bowler hat also resembles that of John Watson, Sherlock's partner. Pinkie also inspects the case in what would be a lengthier parody of Holmes' methods, down to the famous gathering of suspects in one room to reveal the culprit.
*One of the books sticking out of Twilight's bag in her first appearance in the episode is the history book from the beginning of "[[Friendship is Magic, Part 1]]."
*When describing the cake, Pinkie Pie references the Cole Porter song "[[Wikipedia:It's De-Lovely|It's De-Lovely]]" from his 1936 musical "''[[Wikipedia:Red, Hot and Blue|Red, Hot and Blue]]''."
*Mulia Mild's name and mannerisms are a reference to American chef [[Wikipedia:Julia Child|Julia Child]].
*Pinkie's fantasies of the other bakers during her accusations are all allusions to multiple styles and genres of film:
**The Gustave le Grand fantasy references black and white silent films, with Gustave playing the role of the dastardly villain often associated with films from the period. The vignette may also be a specific nod to Snidely Whiplash, himself an animated parody of over-the-top silent film villains (antagonist of ''Dudley Do-Right of the Mounties'' segments on ''The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show'').
**[[Joe|Donut Joe]]'s persona in Pinkie's fantasy, "Con Mane", is a reference to fictional secret agent, [[Wikipedia:James Bond|James Bond]]; additionally, the opening to this fantasy parodies the franchise's iconic [[Wikipedia:gun barrel sequence|gun barrel sequence]]. The mares that surround Joe are a reference to the fact that James Bond hangs around many women.
**Pinkie's fantasy about Mulia destroying the cake is a reference to Japanese ninja genre films.

==[[A Canterlot Wedding - Part 1]]==
*The episode, advertisements and promotions for the episode are all a nod to [[Wikipedia:Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton|the British Royal Wedding of 2011]]. Specifically, the characters' attires match that of the special guests.
*An arrangement of the second movement of Mozart's ''[[wikipedia:Eine kleine Nachtmusik|Eine kleine Nachtmusik]]'' is heard during the opening picnic scene (in-between clips of Spike running).

==[[A Canterlot Wedding - Part 2]]==
*During [[This Day Aria]], [[Queen Chrysalis]] (disguised as [[Princess Cadance]]) looks in the mirror and trashes things around the room, which are a reference to [[w:c:disney:Poor Unfortunate Souls (Reprise)|the reprise of "Poor Unfortunate Souls"]] in the 1989 Disney film ''[[Wikipedia:The Little Mermaid|The Little Mermaid]]''.
*The [[Wikipedia:Bridal Chorus|Bridal Chorus]], composed by [[Wikipedia:Richard Wagner|Richard Wagner]], is used during the wedding sequence. A single phrase is also played during the wedding rehearsal in the prior episode, as a background clip during Twilight and Cadance's confrontation with the bridesmaids.
*During the fight sequence, the six ponies burst through a group of [[Creatures#Changeling|Changelings]] as a dramatic music cue plays. This parallels a sequence from ''[[Wikipedia:The Matrix Reloaded|The Matrix Reloaded]]'', where the protagonist [[w:c:matrix:Neo|Neo]] escapes a mob of [[w:c:matrix:Agent Smith|Agent Smith]]'s clones in the same fashion.
