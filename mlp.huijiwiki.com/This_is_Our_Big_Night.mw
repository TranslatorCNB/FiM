<section begin="song" />
:'''[All]'''
::This is our big night
::We're getting ready
::And we're doing it up right

::This is our big night
::Friendship survived,
::Now we'll start it out right

::The time's right, gonna make it last 'cause it's the first night
::That we're ever gonna start to just have fun together
::We're so glad, so happy we could never be mad
::Did it right now, this is our big night now

::Six friends on the way up now
::Six friends here to show you how

::This is our big night
::We're getting ready
::And we're doing it up right

::This is our big night
::We made it happen
::Now let's party all night

::This is our big night
::This is our big night
::This is our big night
::This is our big night<section end="song" />
