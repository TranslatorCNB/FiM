<section begin="song" />
:'''[云宝黛茜]'''
::When life gives you lemons
::You can make lemonade
::But life gave me Tank here
::And my choice has long been made

::No winter will come to Ponyville
::I'll do it on my own
::I will keep you by my side
::So I will not be alone

::And I'll fly, and I'll fly
::Until the end of the sky
::So I'll be the one who doesn't
::Have to say goodbye

::I'll clear the skies forever
::So we won't be apart
::I'll keep the weather warm for you
::And the winter will never start

::Weather-makers Pegasi
::You make the seasons in the sky
::I don't want to sabotage you
::But you see, I've got to try

::No winter can come here now
::I'll keep the warmth and the sun somehow
::I'm sorry, ponies, this has to be
::For I need my friend and he needs me

::I know it's wrong, but what does it matter?
::'Cause nothing's gonna stop me now
::I'll change it all, it's only the weather
::And nopony's gonna bring me down

::I'll keep the sunlight shining free
::And I'll bust the clouds apart so you can stay with me

::And I'll fly, and I'll fly
::Until the end of the sky
::So I'll be the one who doesn't
::Have to say goodbye

::I'll clear the skies forever
::So we won't be apart
::I'll keep the weather warm for you
::And the winter will never start!<section end="song" />
