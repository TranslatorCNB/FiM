==剧中叙述==
===第一季===
[[File:Diamond Tiara snooty S1E12.png|thumb|{{tr|珠玉冠冠}}邀请{{tr|小苹花}}和{{tr|纠纠}}。]] Most of Diamond Tiara's appearances involve her making fun of others and acting superior and snobbish. In [[Call of the Cutie]], Diamond Tiara makes her first appearance alongside [[Silver Spoon]]，邀请[[小苹花|'''{{tr|小苹花}}''']]和[[Twist]]到她的[[Cutie marks#Cute-ceañera|{{tr|可爱大联欢}}]] to celebrate her recently earned [[Cutie marks|cutie mark]].

{{Quote|I mean, waiting for your cutie mark is ''sooo'' last week. You got yours, I just got mine. We all have them already. [gasp] I mean, almost all of us have them already.|{{tr|珠玉冠冠}}}}

At the cute-ceañera, Apple Bloom tries to hide her lack of a cutie mark by covering her flank with a tablecloth, insisting that she doesn't want to steal attention away from the party's guest of honor. However, when she accidentally exposes her "blank flank", Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon immediately make fun of her. Apple Bloom is soon joined by two other blank flanks named [[Scootaloo]] and [[Sweetie Belle]]. The teasing ends as [[Twilight Sparkle]] and [[Applejack]] explain that being a blank flank means that one has not yet discovered one's true potential. Diamond Tiara later stands alongside Silver Spoon in the stairway, watching the other [[ponies]] play games and upset at no longer being the center of attention.

Diamond Tiara appears again with Silver Spoon on stage at the talent show in [[The Show Stoppers]].

===第二季===
[[File:Diamond Tiara does not want to help Granny Smith S02E12.png|thumb|left|But Daaaaaaad!]] In [[The Return of Harmony Part 1]], Diamond Tiara takes part in the field trip and listens to [[Cheerilee]]'s lecture. In [[The Cutie Pox]], Diamond Tiara tries to prove that Apple Bloom's newly acquired cutie mark is fake. She asks Cheerilee if it is possible for a pony to have two cutie marks, and she appears jealous of Apple Bloom's loopty-hooping talents.

Diamond Tiara appears again in [[Family Appreciation Day]] alongside her father [[Filthy Rich]]. When she visits [[Sweet Apple Acres]] with her father, she points out [[Granny Smith]]'s odd behavior to Apple Bloom and tells her how humiliating it would be if Granny Smith spoke to her class. After Granny Smith impresses Apple Bloom's class with her presentation of how she helped found [[Ponyville]], Diamond Tiara openly denigrates her. At the end of the episode, her father forces her to participate in singing to the water cans, much to her frustration.

[[File:Diamond Tiara with papers S2E23.png|thumb|Diamond Tiara as editor-in-chief of the Foal Free Press.]] Diamond Tiara makes a background appearance in [[Hearts and Hooves Day]], in which "[[Princess Erroria]]" gives her a Hearts and Hooves Day card. In [[Ponyville Confidential]], she becomes the editor-in-chief of the [[Ponyville Schoolhouse]]'s ''Foal Free Press'' newsletter. She appoints the [[Cutie Mark Crusaders]] as writers for the gossip column. Diamond Tiara is impressed by the Crusaders' gossip articles and calls the gossip column her "bread and butter". When the Cutie Mark Crusaders consider resigning to avoid hurting ponies' feelings, Diamond Tiara blackmails them into continuing with embarrassing photos. At the end of the episode, Cheerilee strips Diamond Tiara of her position, replacing her with [[Featherweight]] and demoting her to printing press operator.

===第三季===
[[File:Babs Seed,Diamond Tiara,Silver Spoon and Cutie Mark Crusaders S3E04.png|thumb|left|{{tr|珠玉冠冠}}、{{tr|芭布斯}}和{{tr||白银勺勺}}。]] In [[One Bad Apple]],{{tr|珠玉冠冠}}和{{tr||白银勺勺}}嘲笑 the Cutie Mark Crusaders' float for the Summer Harvest Parade. Apple Bloom's cousin [[Babs Seed]] joins them in bullying the Crusaders until they save her from a sabotaged float. Before Babs leaves Ponyville, Diamond Tiara bemoans her and Silver Spoon being left with the "blank flanks". Babs thus turns on them and threatens to tell their mothers about their behavior. In fear, Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon fall in a mud puddle, and Diamond Tiara's tiara lands on a pig's head.

===第四季===
[[File:Diamond Tiara '...isn't getting off the ground either' S4E05.png|thumb|{{tr|珠玉冠冠}}和{{tr||白银勺勺}}嘲笑{{tr|飞板璐}}的飞行。]] Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon appear in [[Flight to the Finish]]. They compete for the honor of being the Ponyville flag bearers in the Equestria Games. Realizing that the Crusaders might win with their routine, they decide to undermine Scootaloo's confidence by mocking her inability to fly. In the end, the Crusaders win the right to be flag bearers, to Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon's displeasure.

Diamond Tiara appears again in [[Pinkie Pride]] and has a singing role during [[Pinkie the Party Planner]], where she grudgingly admits [[Pinkie Pie]] did a good job planning her cute-ceañera. Before her lines, Silver Spoon walks out of a cafe with a chocolate milkshake; Diamond Tiara pushes her own ice cream off the table and steals it. However, Silver Spoon takes it back while Diamond Tiara is singing.

She and Silver Spoon appear very briefly in a crowd shot in [[Simple Ways]].

[[File:Diamond Tiara with Scootaloo S4E15.png|thumb|left|{{tr|珠玉冠冠}}：{{tr|飞板璐}}的“朋友”。]] In [[Twilight Time]], Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon learn of the Crusaders' "Twilight Time", their personal learning sessions with Princess Twilight, and ask to come along. After this initial encounter, Diamond and Silver tell the rest of their classmates about Twilight Time and pressure the Crusaders in letting them spend time with Twilight as well. When the Crusaders later try to exclude Diamond and the others from Twilight Time, Diamond and Silver lead the other foals to the [[Golden Oak Library]] against their wishes.

When the Crusaders are unable to perform the tasks they'd been learning during Twilight Time, Diamond mocks them, saying they aren't Twilight's "entourage" any more. At this, Twilight remarks that none of the other foals came to Twilight Time to learn, and Diamond leaves the library in disappointment among her classmates.

Diamond Tiara makes a brief appearance alongside Filthy Rich in [[Inspiration Manifestation]]. She and Silver Spoon make a cameo appearance along with various ponies in the end of [[Twilight's Kingdom - Part 2]] to see the newly formed [[Castle of Friendship]].

===第五季===
Diamond Tiara appears alongside Silver Spoon in [[Bloom & Gloom]] during Apple Bloom's first dream. The two of them tease Apple Bloom for having the "lamest cutie mark ever." Later in the episode, Diamond Tiara along with other townfolk start running from a Twittermite infestation that's destroying Ponyville.

[[File:Diamond Tiara surrounded by friends S5E18.png|thumb|{{tr|珠玉冠冠}}接受了友谊。]] Diamond shows a significant change of heart in [[Crusaders of the Lost Mark]]. She begins the episode by running against [[Pipsqueak]] for class president, but when she loses, she is berated by her mother [[Spoiled Rich]]. After the Crusaders spy on her soliloquizing, they invite her to their clubhouse. Upon hearing Pipsqueak reveal that there is not enough money in the budget to repair the school playground, she runs off to the school seemingly to call out Pipsqueak and reclaim her place as class president. When Spoiled Rich berates her again, Diamond Tiara stands up to her mother and has her pass a note along to her father. Her father provides enough money to repair the school playground, and she helps guide the other foals in fixing it.

Diamond Tiara, along with the rest of the school ponies, meets [[Coloratura]] in [[The Mane Attraction]]. She also appears in [[The Cutie Re-Mark - Part 2]] during [[Friends Are Always There For You]].

===第六季===
In [[On Your Marks]] during [[Out On My Own]], Diamond Tiara appears along with Silver Spoon and [[List of ponies/Foals#Peach Fuzz|"Peach Fuzz"]] baking a pie. She also appears in [[A Hearth's Warming Tail]].

In [[The Cart Before the Ponies]], Diamond Tiara appears at the Ponyville Schoolhouse, and she takes part in the Applewood Derby with her butler [[Randolph]]. In [[The Fault in Our Cutie Marks]], Diamond Tiara briefly appears with Silver Spoon and Pipsqueak near Ponyville town hall.

===第七季===

==Personality==
Diamond Tiara is generally shown to be rude, shallow, stuck up, sarcastic, and nasty. Her closest (if not only) friend appears to be [[Silver Spoon]], who often acts as a follower and is usually seen by her side. She sees those without their [[cutie marks]] as inferior and tauntingly refers to them as "blank flanks". Despite the [[Cutie Mark Crusaders]] often being the subject of her ridicule, she will try to "befriend" them if something is in it for her, as seen in [[Twilight Time]]. She also encourages their stories in [[Ponyville Confidential]], but later resorts to blackmailing them.

In [[Crusaders of the Lost Mark]], Diamond Tiara's bullying ways and views toward "blank flanks" are revealed to be a result of her upbringing by her mother [[Spoiled Rich]], who harbors an equal if not deeper contempt for the common social class. Though Diamond Tiara acts according with her mother's teachings, she secretly wants to be better. After standing up to her mother, she displays a friendlier and more generous side, donating money to the school and guiding other ponies through her natural-born leadership.
