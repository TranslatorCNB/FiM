<section begin="song" />
:'''[Flim and Flam]'''
::Oh yes, your apples must be peeled
::By George, and we have got a deal
::You know it's really quite a steal
::The Peelcore Eight Thousand!

::You must remove that nasty core
::But the time it takes is such a chore
::Now your tears and toil they are no more
::The Peelcore Eight Thousand!

::Just step right up and test it out
::You'll be satisfied we have no doubt
::Can we hear everyone now shout it out?
::The Peelcore Eight Thousand!<section end="song"></section>
