:'''[六马组]'''
::It's a pony kind of Christmas
::In every color shade
::All around the world of Equestria
::It's Christmastime here today

::It's a pony kind of Christmas
::Its light never fades
::All around the world of Equestria
::Christmas is here to stay

:'''[暮光闪闪]'''
::Christmas is a time of joy
::When the light of friendship burns bright

:'''[苹果杰克]'''
::Takin' time for family
::To recall the past and do what's right

:'''[小蝶]'''
::And outside gentle snow is falling
::Forest creatures keeping warm below

:'''[六马组]'''
::And all throughout Equestria
::We feel the light of friendship only grow

::It's a pony kind of Christmas
::Its light never fades
::All around the world of Equestria
::Christmas is here to stay

:'''[云宝黛茜]'''
::Dashing through the snow
::In a one-horse open sleigh
::Over the fields we go
::Laughing all the way

:'''[瑞瑞]'''
::Decorate with boughs of holly
::Fill the halls with wonder
::Wrap the presents, silver paper
::Trim the tree and place them under

:'''[萍琪派]'''
::Time for counting down the days to Christmas
::Every day that passes is a party we can throw

:'''[六马组]'''
::Time for counting down the days to Christmas
::And everyday our friendship grows

:'''[六马组及唱诗班]'''
::It's a pony kind of Christmas
::In every color shade
::All around the world of Equestria
::It's Christmastime here today

::It's a pony kind of Christmas
::Its light never fades
::All around the world of Equestria
::Christmas is here...
::To stay<section end="song"/>
