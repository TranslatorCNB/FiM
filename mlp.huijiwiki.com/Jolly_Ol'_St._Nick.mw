:'''[斯派克]'''
::Jolly old St. Nicholas, lean your ear this way
::Don't you tell a single soul what I'm gonna say
::Christmas Eve is coming soon, now, you dear old man
::Whisper what you'll bring to me, tell me if you can

::Jolly old St. Nicholas
::Whatcha gonna bring to me?
::Is it a stash of gems that I can eat all day and night?
::Or is it a diamond ring that I can give to Rarity?

::When the clock is striking twelve and I'm fast asleep
::Down the chimney broad and black, with your pack you'll creep
::All the stockings you will find hanging in a row
::Mine will be the shortest one, you'll be sure to know

::Scatta-boop boop, badda-do bap ba!
::Come and gimme those Christmas presents
::Scootily-boop, scootily-boop, scootily-boop ba!
::Don't make me wait no more
::Babba-doop boop
::Give me some presents!
::Doodle-oop boop daddila boop ba!
::Scabba-doo, scabba-doo
::Come give it to me, Santa, yeah!

::Pinkie Pie wants a candy hat and Applejack wants to cook
::Rainbow wants a lightning chain and Twilight wants a book
::Rarity wants a set of lace and Fluttershy wants a nest
::Now choose for me, dear Santa Claus, what you think is best

::Jolly old St. Nicholas
::Whatcha gonna bring to me?
::Jolly old St. Nicholas
::Whatcha gonna bring
::Whatcha gonna bring to meeeeee?

::Scattily-doo, scattily-doo, scattily-doo wow!
::Yeah!<section end="song"/>
